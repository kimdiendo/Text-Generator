<s> Homarus gammarus Homarus gammarus known as the European lobster or common lobster is a species of unk lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea </s>
<s> It is closely related to the American lobster H americanus </s>
<s> It may grow to a length of cm in and a mass of kilograms lb and bears a conspicuous pair of claws </s>
<s> In life the lobsters are blue only becoming lobster red on cooking </s>
<s> Mating occurs in the summer producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into unk larvae </s>
<s> Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food and is widely caught using lobster pots mostly around the British Isles </s>
<s> Description Homarus gammarus is a large unk with a body length up to centimetres in and weighing up to kilograms lb although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually cm in long and weigh </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> kg </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> lb </s>
<s> Like other crustaceans lobsters have a hard unk which they must shed in order to grow in a process called unk unk </s>
<s> This may occur several times a year for young lobsters but decreases to once every years for larger animals </s>
<s> The first pair of unk is armed with a large asymmetrical pair of claws </s>
<s> The larger one is the unk and has rounded unk used for crushing prey the other is the cutter which has sharp inner edges and is used for holding or tearing the prey </s>
<s> Usually the left claw is the unk and the right is the cutter </s>
<s> The unk is generally blue above with spots that unk and yellow below </s>
<s> The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking </s>
<s> This occurs because in life the red pigment unk is bound to a protein complex but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking releasing the red pigment </s>
<s> The closest relative of H gammarus is the American lobster Homarus americanus </s>
<s> The two species are very similar and can be crossed artificially although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap </s>
<s> The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics The unk of H americanus bears one or more spines on the underside which are lacking in H gammarus </s>
<s> The spines on the claws of H americanus are red or red tipped while those of H gammarus are white or white tipped </s>
<s> The underside of the claw of H americanus is orange or red while that of H gammarus is creamy white or very pale red </s>
<s> Life cycle Female H gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of millimetres </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size </s>
<s> Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently unk female whose shell is therefore soft and a hard shelled male </s>
<s> The female carries the eggs for up to months depending on the temperature attached to her unk </s>
<s> Females carrying eggs are said to be unk and can be found throughout the year </s>
<s> The eggs hatch at night and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents preying on unk </s>
<s> This stage involves three unk and lasts for days </s>
<s> After the third moult the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult and adopts a unk lifestyle </s>
<s> The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild and are poorly known although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows </s>
<s> It is estimated that only larva in every survives to the unk phase </s>
<s> When they reach a carapace length of mm </s>
<s> in the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives </s>
<s> Distribution Homarus gammarus is found across the north eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco not including the Baltic Sea </s>
<s> It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea only missing from the section east of Crete and along only the north west coast of the Black Sea </s>
<s> The unk populations are found in the Norwegian unk unk and unk inside the Arctic Circle </s>
<s> The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations one widespread population and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes possibly due to adaptation to the local environment </s>
<s> The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway which have been referred to as the midnight sun lobster </s>
<s> The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean </s>
<s> The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands samples from the unk were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel </s>
<s> Attempts have been made to introduce H gammarus to New Zealand alongside other European species such as the edible crab Cancer unk </s>
<s> Between and one million lobster larvae were released from unk in unk but the species did not become established there </s>
<s> Ecology Adult H gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of metres unk ft although not normally deeper than m ft </s>
<s> They prefer hard substrates such as rocks or hard mud and live in holes or crevices emerging at night to feed </s>
<s> The diet of H gammarus mostly consists of other unk invertebrates </s>
<s> These include crabs molluscs sea unk unk and polychaete worms </s>
<s> The three unk lobster species Homarus gammarus H americanus and unk unk are hosts to the three known species of the animal unk unk the species on H gammarus has not been described </s>
<s> Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease unk caused by the unk unk unk </s>
<s> Although it is frequently found in American lobsters the disease has only been seen in captive H gammarus where prior occupation of the tanks by H americanus could not be ruled out </s>
<s> Human consumption Homarus gammarus is traditionally highly esteemed as a unk and was mentioned in The unk a seventeenth century English folk song </s>
<s> It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh frozen canned or powdered </s>
<s> Both the claws and the abdomen of H gammarus contain excellent white meat and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible </s>
<s> The exceptions are the unk mill and the sand vein gut </s>
<s> The price of H gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H americanus and the European species is considered to have a better flavour </s>
<s> unk are mostly fished using lobster pots although lines unk with unk or unk sometimes succeed in tempting them out to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand </s>
<s> In t of H gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa of which t was caught in the British Isles including the Channel Islands </s>
<s> The minimum landing size for H gammarus is a carapace length of mm </s>

<s> unk systems for H gammarus are under development and production rates are still very low </s>
<s> unk history Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema unk published in </s>
<s> That name was Cancer gammarus since Linnaeus concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans </s>
<s> H gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber as determined by Direction of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature </s>
<s> Prior to that direction confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names including unk unk unk and Homarus vulgaris H Milne Edwards and also because Friedrich Weber s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary unk rendering any prior assignments of type species for Homarus H Milne Edwards invalid for Homarus Weber </s>
<s> The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a unk selected by unk unk in </s>
<s> It came from N E near unk Sweden kilometres or miles northwest of Gothenburg but both it and the unk have since been lost </s>
<s> The common name for H gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is European lobster but the species is also widely known as the common lobster </s>

<s> History The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing unk interchange that accommodated vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas </s>
<s> It was a collaborative project between the unk affected motorists and property owners and the primary contractor unk Construction </s>
<s> An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible </s>
<s> Reasons for upgrading the interchange in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion were to improve air quality safety and local access </s>
<s> unk Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the million contract by unk the largest ever by that agency </s>
<s> The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts </s>

<s> Also built into the construction contract was a provision that unk was charged for lane rentals by unk for time they closed down traffic lanes fees based on unk assessments and the time of day the lane was closed </s>
<s> The fees ranged from to a high of for rush hours </s>
<s> In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and unk so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed </s>
<s> Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished </s>
<s> To save time and money innovative construction methods were employed The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans used to direct connect roads to be made of steel but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction cast in place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans </s>
<s> However unk decided to use unk concrete segmental bridges rather than casting the bridge elements in place and used a unique machine designed and constructed by Deal unk of Italy and costing about million to move the pieces into place </s>
<s> During the construction </s>

<s> The unk armies captured the capital unk on January unk and went on to unk much of the kingdom by unk </s>
<s> The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the unk as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song </s>
<s> For the next dozen years they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India </s>
<s> The Mongols set up military garrisons manned mostly by unk speaking Muslims from Central Asia in circuits of the former unk Kingdom </s>
<s> Decline of Pagan By then the Pagan Empire despite outward appearances of calm had been in long and slow decline since the early century </s>
<s> The continuous growth of tax free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom </s>
<s> The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges </s>
<s> Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in unk in South unk and unk unk the decline continued </s>
<s> On the eve of the unk invasions between one and two thirds of Upper Burma s unk land had been donated to religion </s>
<s> The crown s ability to unk defenses was in serious jeopardy </s>
<s> Prelude to war First unk mission The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early unk </s>
<s> By then the Song were on the ropes and Emperor unk Khan who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on December sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions </s>
<s> In Pagan s case he had ordered the unk governor of unk to unk control of the unk and in January to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute </s>

<s> This will add to your reputation and be in your own interests for if it comes to war who will be the victor </s>
<s> unk well O king Our words </s>

<s> By the early century several Tai Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present day unk to northern and eastern unk to northern and central Thailand and Laos </s>

<s> The Mongols who were still trying to incorporate unk into the central administration were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of unk into the fold </s>
<s> The integration of unk itself into China unk was to take several more centuries and continues to today </s>
<s> As such from the newly formed Tai Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and unk in eastern Southeast Asia the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute </s>

<s> unk was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly </s>
<s> unk continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical </s>
<s> However due to the location of the storm there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity </s>
<s> Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification </s>
<s> The storm was also heading into an area where shear was unk to significantly increase due to an upper level trough diving southward </s>
<s> Despite convection being partially removed from the center of unk the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized </s>
<s> The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger </s>
<s> unk reached its peak intensity of mph km h around am unk as it continued to become more organized </s>
<s> However there were indications that it had already begun to weaken </s>
<s> unk towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm a sign that dry air was entering the system </s>
<s> During the afternoon hours the structure of unk began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll </s>
<s> By the late night the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center </s>
<s> Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear a large deep burst of convection formed in the northern unk of unk </s>
<s> The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity </s>
<s> The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as unk continued westward and no change in intensity over the day forecast was predicted </s>
<s> However the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and unk weakened again </s>
<s> By the afternoon the center of unk was only a unk of clouds devoid of convection </s>
<s> During the overnight hours on September into the morning of September convection associated with unk began to unk somewhat mostly to the north of the circulation due to the strong unk wind shear </s>
<s> By mid morning unk re intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection </s>
<s> However the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on unk by late morning </s>
<s> The convection around the system became unk from the center and unk weakened slightly </s>
<s> The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong unk shear </s>
<s> unk became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid afternoon and the storm weakened to mph km h barely holding on to tropical storm status </s>
<s> unk regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm </s>
<s> Due to the lack of convection unk was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at unk unk with winds of mph km h </s>
<s> Since there was no convection around the system it would have normally been classified a remnant low but due to the possibility of the storm unk over the next several days it was considered a tropical depression </s>
<s> The next morning unk was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm </s>
<s> No redevelopment was expected with unk as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated </s>
<s> However the remnant low associated with unk began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September </s>
<s> unk around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed </s>
<s> On September wind shear took over the system again </s>
<s> unk around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more </s>
<s> The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed </s>
<s> Finally on September wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of unk deteriorating into an open wave </s>
<s> However on September the remnants of unk redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system </s>
<s> Once more the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of unk headed towards the Bahamas </s>
<s> However on September dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely </s>
<s> Impact As unk passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September outer rain bands produced minor rainfall totaling around </s>

<s> unk for the unk and unk for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries but there were no further scores in the game </s>
<s> The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed </s>
<s> In the Home Nations Championship Wales had unk the four three quarter system wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine and instead employ an extra centre three quarter </s>
<s> The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward </s>
<s> With Gould working in the West Indies Wales again tried the four three quarter system against the unk and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system </s>

<s> The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home unk over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board unk </s>
<s> Following a disputed try in an England Scotland international match in the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote arguing that they deserved this as they were they asserted the senior body and had the most member clubs </s>
<s> Ireland Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until when following arbitration the RFU relented and joined the unk </s>

<s> While this was happening one of the English players Frank unk picked up the ball and scored a try </s>
<s> The New Zealanders protested believing that play had stopped after claiming unk had called dead ball but Hill awarded the try prompting three of the Native players Dick unk Williams and unk unk to leave the field in protest </s>
<s> The unk players were eventually persuaded to return but not before Hill had unk play </s>
<s> unk was very critical of Hill particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU </s>
<s> unk wrote after the tour that gross as these errors were they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game unk unk at all in that game </s>
<s> The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English who ultimately won </s>
<s> The RFU at Hill s instigation promptly demanded an apology from the unk captain of the day Edward unk who had led the team as Joe unk was injured </s>
<s> The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike </s>
<s> The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players in other words the entire rugby playing population of England from facing the unk if they did not unk </s>
<s> unk swiftly sent an apology by telegram but this was deemed inadequate he therefore sent another four days after the game The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders approach to the game reports of rough and over aggressive play by the unk had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain </s>

<s> The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain </s>
<s> They eventually played Southern Counties and beat them </s>
<s> This was their unk match in the British Isles and their victory </s>
<s> The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively and the unk boarded ship without a formal farewell </s>
<s> This perceived unk from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London as well as from the team manager Scott who felt that with the team s official apology after the England match the controversy should have put to rest </s>
<s> Australia The majority of the unk left Plymouth on March unk and Pie unk followed a week later </s>
<s> They arrived in Melbourne in May where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football hoping to make more money that way </s>
<s> Although the side had employed Jack unk to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training </s>
<s> As a result the Victorian Rules matches were a failure the players unk with the rules combined with the fact that most of the unk were rugby forwards and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds </s>
<s> The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total including one in New South Wales but won only three of them all against relatively weak opposition </s>

<s> Following the loss of unk the play of the unk improved and they recovered to win </s>
<s> Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered by unk to throw the game </s>
<s> unk later said It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought in racing unk to be playing stiff and that they had been got by some unk at all events when accused of it at half time and cautioned they played a different game in the second half </s>

<s> The thrust unk laid yards m of unk through which the unk cable was pulled into position </s>
<s> The mill was then supplied with lights and unk on each floor </s>
<s> Other work undertaken by the unk involved repairing some unk damage to the foundation brickwork digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position </s>

<s> When the mill was modernised in it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails </s>
<s> The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter </s>
<s> The brake wheel was also rebuilt with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original unk resulting in a wheel feet inches </s>

<s> Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows with only one window still needing attention when the first work in began </s>
<s> New beech unk were fitted to the crown wheel which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft </s>
<s> The stocks and sails were made during the two work ins held in July and August a total of people attending over the two weeks </s>
<s> A second hand stock had been bought in the and preserved at the mill but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use </s>
<s> Thus two new stocks were required instead of one </s>
<s> Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and unk grounds leaving two options </s>
<s> Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber or unk stocks </s>
<s> Good quality pitch pine was not unk in the lengths required </s>
<s> Douglas fir was unk in such lengths but was discounted on strength and unk grounds </s>

<s> All timber had been pressure treated with unk and well unk </s>
<s> It was estimated that a unk stock would be up to stronger than a similar stock of solid timber </s>
<s> The timber used was inches mm thick and nine unk were required at the centre where the stock passes through the poll end of the unk </s>
<s> unk attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber </s>
<s> Both stocks were made during the work in with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use </s>
<s> The stocks were the first unk stocks made by amateurs </s>
<s> The four sails were made </s>
<s> The originals being slightly different pairs </s>
<s> Those on the inner stock having bays of feet mm pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of feet inches mm pitch </s>
<s> It was decided that the new sails would be identical at the larger pitch </s>
<s> Four feet </s>
<s> m long unk were cut from a unk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished unk at Bury St unk </s>

<s> At the end of the second work in the cap could be turned by means of the hand unk </s>
<s> The unk itself with the unk painted red white and blue was installed shortly afterwards </s>
<s> The unk arm brake wheel was assembled around the unk </s>
<s> It was found that the unk was eccentric on the upright shaft by inch mm </s>
<s> When this was corrected the brake wheel was within unk of an inch less than mm of true </s>
<s> The unk for the stocks were unk from a unk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year </s>
<s> Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors cleaning and painting unk and further unk on the brickwork </s>
<s> The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work in </s>
<s> The stock with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the unk and when unk in position and the unk had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock </s>
<s> The process was repeated for the second pair of sails </s>
<s> The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work in </s>

<s> Military history of Australia The military history of Australia spans the nation s year modern history from the early Australian frontier wars between unk and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early century </s>
<s> Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity including the Anzac spirit </s>
<s> The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma </s>
<s> As British unk the Australian colonies participated in Britain s small wars of the century while later as a unk dominion and then an independent nation Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War as well as in the wars in Korea Malaya Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War </s>
<s> In the Post Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions through the United Nations and other agencies including in the Sinai Persian Gulf unk Somalia East Timor and the Solomon Islands while more recently they have also fought as part of multi lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan </s>
<s> In total nearly Australians died during the course of these conflicts </s>
<s> War and Australian society For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the century it continues to influence Australian society to this day </s>
<s> War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history while a major part of the national identity has been built on an unk conception of the Australian experience of war and of unk known as the Anzac spirit </s>
<s> These ideals include notions of endurance courage ingenuity humour unk unk and unk traits which according to popular thought defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War </s>
<s> The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity </s>
<s> The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture unk with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare </s>
<s> Indeed Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of while since then an alliance with the United States has unk its security </s>
<s> unk this pattern of unk both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs as well as for more unk security concerns has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies </s>
<s> Regardless a tendency towards strategic unk has also been evident with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to unk resources until a crisis arises a trait which has historically resulted in unk for major military challenges </s>
<s> Reflecting both the realist and liberal unk of international relations and the conception of national interests a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious </s>
<s> Such themes include an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics the unk of notions of unk sovereignty a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a unk of security and the proposition that the status unk in international affairs should only be changed peacefully </s>
<s> Likewise unk collective security and defence self reliance have also been important themes </s>
<s> Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic unk have persisted throughout its history being the product of Australian society s democratic political tradition and unk Christian Anglo European heritage as well its associated values beliefs and economic political and religious ideology </s>
<s> These unk are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia Pacific and the unk circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power </s>
<s> To be sure during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result it has frequently become involved in foreign wars </s>
<s> Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers known colloquially as unk have often been noted somewhat unk for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities </s>
<s> Colonial era British Forces in Australia From until the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces </s>
<s> Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island however they were relieved of these duties in by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service known as the New South Wales Corps </s>
<s> The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in </s>
<s> Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van unk s Land </s>
<s> Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion a coup mounted by its officers in </s>
<s> As a result in January the unk Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia </s>
<s> By British infantry regiments had served in Australia as had a small number of artillery and engineer units </s>
<s> Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack no actual threat ever unk </s>
<s> The British Army was instead used in policing guarding convicts at penal institutions combating unk putting down convict rebellions as occurred at Bathurst in and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement </s>
<s> Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the unk unk in on the Victorian unk </s>
<s> Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India Afghanistan New Zealand and the Sudan </s>
<s> During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station based in Sydney </s>
<s> However in Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a unk marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia </s>
<s> The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy the Royal Navy s depots dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people </s>
<s> Frontier warfare The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied but were inevitably hostile when the settler s presence led to competition over resources and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants lands </s>
<s> European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation </s>
<s> By and large neither the British nor the unk approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare </s>
<s> At times however the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units </s>
<s> Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands while many unk served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes </s>
<s> Fighting between unk and Europeans was localised as the unk did not form unk capable of sustained resistance </s>
<s> As a result there was not a single war but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent </s>
<s> unk or disorganised however a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the century and continuing into the early century </s>
<s> This warfare unk the popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in Australia </s>
<s> Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres </s>
<s> Among the most famous is the Battle of unk in Western Australia in </s>
<s> Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however and after the unk Creek massacre in New South Wales in seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings </s>
<s> However in Tasmania the so called Black War was fought between and and aimed at driving most of the island s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas </s>
<s> Although it began in failure for the British it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population </s>
<s> It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly unk by Europeans on unk </s>
<s> Although many more unk died than British this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans </s>
<s> Aboriginal tactics varied but were mainly based on pre existing hunting and fighting practices using unk clubs and other primitive weapons </s>
<s> Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America on the main unk failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans </s>
<s> Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms this was not widespread </s>
<s> The unk were never a serious military threat to European settlers regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them </s>
<s> On occasions large groups of unk attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued during which the unk would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage </s>
<s> This could sometimes be effective with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their unk while the settlers unk </s>
<s> However such open warfare usually proved more costly for the unk than the Europeans </s>
<s> Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms </s>
<s> However the advantages afforded by firearms have often been unk </s>
<s> Prior to the late century firearms were often unk muzzle loading smooth bore single shot unk with flint lock mechanisms </s>
<s> Such weapons produced a low rate of fire while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within metres ft </s>
<s> These deficiencies may have initially given the unk an advantage allowing them to move in close and engage with unk or clubs </s>
<s> Yet by significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage with the six shot unk revolver the unk single shot breech loading rifle and later the unk Henry rifle as well as rapid fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle becoming available </s>
<s> These weapons when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of unk often proved successful </s>
<s> The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast moving often hidden enemies </s>
<s> Tactics employed included night time surprise attacks and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks </s>
<s> The conflict lasted for over years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia </s>
<s> Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the </s>
<s> As the frontier moved west so did the conflict pushing into outback New South Wales in the </s>

<s> Colonial military forces From until each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence </s>
<s> The colonies had gained responsible government between and and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia </s>
<s> To do this they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces </s>
<s> Initially these were militias in support of British regulars but when military support for the colonies ended in the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities </s>
<s> The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia paid citizen soldiers and a small permanent component </s>
<s> They were mainly infantry cavalry and mounted infantry and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline </s>
<s> Even after significant reforms in the including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and unk to be considered armies in the modern sense </s>
<s> By the forces numbered men </s>
<s> Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the century with the colonies raising unk to serve in Sudan South Africa and China </s>
<s> Despite a reputation of colonial unk many of the locally raised units were highly organised disciplined professional and well trained </s>
<s> During this period defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery based on garrisoned coastal forts </s>
<s> However by the improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid unk of brigades of infantry </s>
<s> As a consequence he called for a unk of defences and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies </s>
<s> Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be unk and for professional units obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific to replace the volunteer forces </s>

<s> Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies with the ironclad unk Cerberus in service from as well as the steam sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy three small gunboats and five torpedo boats </s>

<s> The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in while South Australia operated a single ship HMCS Protector </s>
<s> Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps while Western Australia s only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery </s>
<s> Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the unk Rebellion in China in while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action </s>

<s> After the outbreak of war plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate unk to serve with British formations with two squadrons each of men from New South Wales and Victoria and one each from the other colonies </s>

<s> The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men animals and equipment </s>
<s> These buildings were on the edges of a foot m parade ground </s>
<s> The post unk Captain Thomas Swords was in charge of building Fort Scott s structures and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie which had few trees </s>

<s> Everyone becomes unk upon eating the unk including the family cat and the film concludes </s>
<s> No cast or staff credits for this film are known </s>
<s> The film was released on September to mixed reviews in trade publications </s>
<s> Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one unk split eight ways would be able to impact everyone </s>
<s> The film is presumed lost </s>
<s> Plot Though the film is presumed lost a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September </s>
<s> It states Life in a country town is often tedious and unk and were it not for the little unk and unk the unk are constantly given existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed </s>
<s> So the time honored get unk of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay </s>
<s> The unk thought well of this established feature </s>
<s> They made it a unk occasion for themselves as well as their guests </s>
<s> They were hardly an overly wealthy family and their table was never notable for an unk of the good things of life but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time </s>
<s> On the night before such an event neither unk unk or unk Gale could get those minutes solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests comfort </s>
<s> At the first unk of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the unk into shape </s>
<s> So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured when the prize dish was a splendid unk unk unk the unk were ever looking after the need of the said unk </s>
<s> First unk Gale would unk to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state and give it a stir then unk Gale would unk over and give it a stir finally unk Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise </s>
<s> Then arrived the guests </s>
<s> The Minister and the Mrs Minister they were and some neighbors </s>
<s> While she was receiving them the recollection came to unk Gale that the beloved unk unk had not received its unk </s>
<s> Off she speeds to a unk of whiskey in the kitchen </s>
<s> She unk into the unk the right proportion of liquor and goes back to her guests </s>
<s> Then unk Gale remembers that the unk has not been flavored </s>
<s> He too unk himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred unk </s>
<s> No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than unk Gale who has just remembered about the forgotten unk rushes in and makes for the whiskey </s>
<s> She unk the right proportion in too </s>
<s> Production The writer of the scenario is unknown but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan </s>
<s> He was an experienced unk employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions </s>
<s> The film director is unknown but it may have been Barry O Neil </s>
<s> Film historian Q David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production but at least two possible candidates exist </s>
<s> Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer </s>
<s> The role of the cameraman was unk in productions </s>
<s> The cast credits are unknown but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary </s>

<s> The list includes unk unk unk D Barnes Frank H Crane Irene Crane Marie unk unk unk Martin J Faust Thomas Fortune George Middleton Grace Moore John W Noble Anna unk Mrs George Walters </s>
<s> A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors </s>
<s> Release and reception The single reel comedy approximately feet long was released on September </s>
<s> The film likely had a wide national release with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana Kansas Wisconsin and Pennsylvania </s>
<s> The film would also be shown in Vancouver Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre </s>
<s> In years after the film s release the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of unk of Moving Pictures </s>
<s> The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long but did not find it to be a fault </s>
<s> The reviewer states A domestic comedy with a different flavor </s>
<s> In fact with a unk unk for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of unk neither one knowing that the others have done likewise </s>
<s> The humor in this piece centers around this unk </s>
<s> What happened to the guests who unk of it certainly draws upon the imagination </s>
<s> Imagine eight people not to speak of the cat getting drunk on the brandy in one unk unk </s>
<s> We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week </s>
<s> unk as well as unk were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters </s>
<s> The unk unk episode was well done which is the faint praise that we do not like to unk out to anyone </s>
<s> Walton of The Moving Picture News was not unk by the plot and stated To me the last scene had no humor </s>
<s> It was only the necessary ending to the beginning </s>
<s> True humor does not unk from unk </s>
<s> The New York Dramatic Mirror stated This is the old story of too many cooks and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way </s>
<s> The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation </s>
<s> A weak point in the story is the fact that the unk is cut into eight small pieces making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power </s>
<s> Two unk would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing </s>
<s> The character parts are all well taken although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera </s>

<s> The song was performed on a Los Angeles unk for the filming of its music video which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video </s>
<s> Writing and recording The music for Where the Streets Have No Name originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions </s>
<s> In an upstairs room at unk House his newly purchased home The Edge used a four track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards bass guitar and a drum machine </s>
<s> unk that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs The Edge wanted to unk up the ultimate live song so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future show if he were a fan </s>
<s> After finishing the rough mix he felt he had come up with the most amazing guitar part and song of his life </s>
<s> With no one in the house to share the demo with The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration </s>
<s> Although the band liked the demo it was difficult for them to record the song </s>
<s> unk Adam Clayton said At the time it sounded like a foreign language whereas now we understand how it works </s>
<s> The arrangement with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes was unk many times but the group struggled to get a performance they liked </s>
<s> According to co producer Daniel Lanois that was the science project song </s>
<s> I remember having this massive schoolhouse unk as we call them </s>
<s> I was holding a pointer like a college professor walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking unk </s>
<s> It was ridiculous </s>
<s> Co producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of Where the Streets Have No Name </s>
<s> The band worked on a single take for weeks but as Eno explained that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up </s>
<s> Through all of their work they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance </s>
<s> So much time had been spent on unk work that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch </s>
<s> His idea was to stage an accident and have the song s tapes erased </s>
<s> He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance </s>
<s> At one point Eno had the tapes unk up and ready to be recorded over but this unk never took place according to engineer Flood fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes dropped the unk of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno </s>
<s> The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes </s>
<s> It was one of several songs mixed by Steve unk in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree </s>
<s> Drummer Larry Mullen Jr later said of the song It took so long to get that song right it was difficult for us to make any sense of it </s>

<s> After the third chorus the song s unk is played the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction with a six note guitar unk played against sustained unk notes </s>
<s> Lyrics The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast Northern Ireland where a person s religion and income are evident by the street they live on </s>
<s> He contrasted this with the unk he felt when visiting Ethiopia saying the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren t such divisions a place where the streets have no name </s>
<s> To me that s the way a great rock n roll concert should be a place where everyone comes together Maybe that s the dream of all art to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all </s>
<s> Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife Ali Hewson he first wrote them down on an unk bag while staying in a village </s>
<s> According to him the song is ostensibly about unk elevation whatever you want to call it </s>
<s> Bono who compared many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to sketches said that Where the Streets Have No Name is more like the of old than any of the other songs on the LP because it s a sketch I was just trying to sketch a location maybe a spiritual location maybe a romantic location </s>
<s> I was trying to sketch a feeling </s>
<s> The open ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations </s>
<s> Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send a message of hope and wish for a world that is not divided by class wealth race or any other arbitrary criterion </s>
<s> With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song he said I m not sure really about that </s>
<s> I used to think it was Belfast Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono s and his wife Ali s visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid workers </s>
<s> Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open ended lyrics I can look at it now and recognize that the song has one of the most unk couplets in the history of pop music </s>
<s> But it also contains some of the biggest ideas </s>
<s> In a curious way that seems to work </s>

<s> Track listing Personnel Charts unk unk reaction The unk unk reaction often referred to as simply the unk unk is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of unk </s>
<s> The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants depending on the reagents and substrates employed </s>
<s> It was originally discovered by Ivan unk unk in while studying the unk of unk vinyl unk </s>
<s> As originally described the unk unk involves the activation of a unk unk using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or unk acid promoter </s>
<s> The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a unk unk unk ring closure which forms the unk product See unk below </s>
<s> As the reaction has been developed variants involving substrates other than unk unk and unk other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name unk unk provided that they follow a similar unk pathway </s>
<s> The success of the unk unk as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and unk of unk as both motifs in natural products including unk the unk and a unk of unk and as useful synthetic unk for total synthesis </s>
<s> The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published </s>
<s> unk The mechanism of the classical unk unk reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by unk to be an unk unk and is outlined below </s>
<s> unk of the unk by the acid catalyst generates a unk cation which undergoes a unk allowed unk unk unk as dictated by the Woodward Hoffman rules </s>
<s> This generates an unk cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β hydrogen </s>
<s> Subsequent unk of the unk produces the unk product </s>
<s> As noted above variants that deviate from this template are known what unk a unk unk in particular is the generation of the unk cation followed by unk ring closure to an unk cation </s>
<s> In order to achieve this transformation the molecule must be in the s trans s trans conformation placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation </s>
<s> The unk of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate with α substituted substrates having an increased population of the unk unk due to unk strain </s>
<s> unk of an electron unk α unk by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation </s>
<s> Similarly β substitution directed inward unk the s trans conformation so severely that E Z unk has been shown to occur in advance of unk on a wide range of substrates yielding the trans unk regardless of initial configuration </s>
<s> In this way the unk unk is a rare example of a unk unk reaction whereas most unk are unk </s>
<s> The example below uses unk hydride to trap the unk cation so that no elimination occurs </s>
<s> See unk unk below Along this same vein unk vinyl unk of the type studied extensively by Marcus unk of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β unk unk a large amount of unk strain in the s unk unk </s>
<s> Classical unk unk Though unk following the general template above had been observed prior to unk s involvement it was his study of the unk of unk vinyl unk that marked the first major examination of this process </s>
<s> unk correctly reasoned that the unk unk unk in situ to form a unk unk before ring closure to the unk product </s>
<s> The reaction shown below involves an unk unk reaction to generate the unk unk </s>
<s> Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years until in the mid when several syntheses employing the unk unk were published </s>
<s> unk below are key steps in the syntheses of unk and Nor unk the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual unk unk unk that generates the unk unk </s>
<s> unk The classical version of the unk unk suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to unk </s>
<s> The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone but are indicative of the barriers to unk the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and unk of the intermediate </s>
<s> Strong Lewis or unk acids are typically required for the reaction eg </s>
<s> unk unk unk </s>
<s> These unk are not compatible with sensitive functional groups limiting the substrate scope </s>
<s> Despite the unk possibility for catalysis multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction </s>
<s> This limits the atom economy of the reaction </s>
<s> The elimination step is not unk if multiple β unk are available for elimination various products are often observed as mixtures </s>
<s> This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as unk separation is typically required </s>
<s> unk destroys a potential unk decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction </s>
<s> unk of the unk is sometimes not unk meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of unk </s>
<s> Modern variants The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the unk unk reaction in its canonical form </s>
<s> However modifications to the reaction focused on unk its issues continue to be an active area of academic research </s>
<s> In particular the research has focused on a few key areas rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter unk the reaction with more mild unk to improve functional group tolerance directing the unk of the elimination step and improving the overall unk </s>
<s> These have been successful to varying degrees </s>
<s> Additionally modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction either by generating the unk cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the unk cation intercepted in various ways </s>
<s> Furthermore enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed </s>
<s> The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field key examples are given below </s>
<s> unk directed unk The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the unk unk took advantage of the β silicon effect in order to direct the unk of the elimination step </s>
<s> This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois unk unk in the mid and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron unk to promote the reaction </s>
<s> With unk products the unk unk was selected for to varying degrees </s>
<s> The silicon directed unk unk reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product unk shown below </s>
<s> The unk takes place before elimination of the unk alcohol unk so that the resulting unk of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the unk unk anti to the unk </s>
<s> unk Drawing on the unk effects compiled over various trials of the reaction Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for polarized unk unk in which electron unk and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction </s>
<s> Creation of an effective vinyl unk and vinyl unk in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper unk and unk elimination </s>
<s> In addition the electron withdrawing group increases the unk of the α proton allowing selective formation of the trans α unk via unk </s>
<s> It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a unk or withdrawing group alone although the efficiency of the reaction yield reaction time etc </s>
<s> is typically lower </s>
<s> Alternative cation generation By extension any unk cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a unk unk </s>
<s> There have been a large number of examples published where the unk cation is arrived at by a variety of unk </s>
<s> One such example involves the silver unk unk ring opening of unk unk unk </s>
<s> The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of unk silver chloride </s>
<s> In the total synthesis of unk unk of a vinyl unk unk likewise generates a unk cation via ring opening of the resultant unk </s>
<s> unk unk Once the unk has occurred an unk cation is formed </s>
<s> As discussed extensively above the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by unk unk </s>
<s> However these two steps can be interrupted by various unk and unk respectively </s>
<s> unk cation trapping has been developed extensively by unk G West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field </s>
<s> The unk cation can be trapped with unk and carbon unk and can also undergo unk unk with various unk partners </s>
<s> unk below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a unk core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity </s>
<s> unk trapping with various unk is unk less common </s>
<s> In one study the unk unk is paired with a Michael reaction using an unk catalyst to initiate nucleophilic unk addition of the unk to β unk </s>
<s> In this tandem reaction the unk catalyst is required for both unk it acts as the Lewis acid in the unk unk and in the next step the unk group of unk first coordinates to unk in a ligand exchange with the unk unk oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R group </s>
<s> unk variants The development of an enantioselective unk unk is a desirable addition to the repertoire of unk unk reactions </s>
<s> To that end several variations have been developed utilizing unk unk and unk unk </s>
<s> unk unk are also known in which extant unk direct the unk </s>
<s> Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of unk selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to unk in turn sets the unk as shown below </s>
<s> unk directed unk unk can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way </s>
<s> In the example below the unk group acts to direct the unk by preventing the distant unk from rotating towards it via unfavorable unk interaction </s>
<s> In this way the silicon acts as a unk auxiliary </s>
<s> The starting material is not unk but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the unk </s>
<s> unk s unk substrates can exhibit axial to unk unk transfer if unk unk are used </s>
<s> The example below generates a unk unk in yield and enantiomeric excess </s>
<s> unk has additionally developed a camphor based auxiliary for unk unk that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of unk </s>
<s> The key step employs an unusual mixture of unk unk and unk as solvent </s>
<s> The first unk Lewis acid promoted asymmetric unk unk was reported by unk Aggarwal and utilized copper II unk ligand complexes with up to ee </s>
<s> The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of unk of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased </s>
<s> Related Reactions unk of the unk unk are generally also subsumed under the same name </s>
<s> For example an α β γ unk unk unk can undergo a similar unk unk unk that is typically referred to as an unk unk unk reaction </s>
