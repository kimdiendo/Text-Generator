<s> Filmography Film Television Theatre Du Fu Du Fu Wade Giles Tu Fu Chinese unk unk was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty </s>
<s> Along with Li unk Li Po he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets </s>
<s> His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations </s>
<s> His life like the whole country was devastated by the An unk Rebellion of unk and his last years were a time of almost constant unrest </s>
<s> Although initially he was little known to other writers his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture </s>
<s> Of his poetic writing nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages </s>
<s> He has been called the Poet Historian and the Poet Sage by Chinese critics while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as the Chinese Virgil Horace unk Shakespeare Milton Burns unk unk Hugo or unk </s>
<s> Life Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work a practice which Burton Watson attributes to the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality </s>
<s> Since many of Du Fu s poems feature morality and history this practice is particularly important </s>
<s> Another reason identified by the Chinese historian William unk is that Chinese poems are typically unk unk context that might be relevant but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know </s>
<s> For modern Western readers The less accurately we know the time the place and the circumstances in the background the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly and the result will be that we either unk the poem or fail to understand it altogether </s>
<s> Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu arguing that the variety of the poet s work required consideration of his whole life rather than the unk unk used for more limited poets </s>
<s> Early years Most of what is known of Du Fu s life comes from his poems </s>
<s> His paternal grandfather was Du unk a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu </s>
<s> Du Fu was born in unk the exact birthplace is unknown except that it was near Luoyang Henan province Gong county is a favourite candidate </s>
<s> In later life he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang an ancestral hometown of the Du family </s>
<s> Du Fu s mother died shortly after he was born and he was partially raised by his aunt </s>
<s> He had an elder brother who died young </s>
<s> He also had three half brothers and one half sister to whom he frequently refers in his poems although he never mentions his stepmother </s>
<s> The son of a minor scholar official his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant study and unk of the Confucian classics of philosophy history and poetry </s>
<s> He later claimed to have produced unk poems by his early teens but these have been lost </s>
<s> In the early unk he travelled in the unk Zhejiang area his earliest surviving poem describing a poetry contest is thought to date from the end of this period around </s>
<s> In that year he took the civil service exam likely in Chang an </s>
<s> He failed to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics </s>
<s> unk concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure while Chou suggests his failure to unk connections in the capital may have been to blame </s>
<s> After this failure he went back to traveling this time around Shandong and Hebei </s>
<s> His father died around </s>
<s> Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father s rank but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers </s>
<s> He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs </s>
<s> In the autumn of unk he met Li unk Li Po for the first time and the two poets formed a friendship </s>
<s> David Young describes this as the most significant formative element in Du Fu s artistic development because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam </s>
<s> The relationship was somewhat one sided however </s>
<s> Du Fu was by some years the younger while Li unk was already a poetic star </s>
<s> We have twelve poems to or about Li unk from the younger poet but only one in the other direction </s>
<s> They met again only once in unk </s>
<s> In he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career </s>
<s> He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals </s>
<s> He never again attempted the examinations instead unk the emperor directly in unk and probably again in unk </s>
<s> He married around unk and by unk the couple had had five children three sons and two daughters but one of the sons died in infancy in unk </s>
<s> From he began to have lung problems probably asthma the first of a series of unk which unk him for the rest of his life </s>
<s> It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region </s>
<s> In unk he received an appointment as unk of the Right Commandant s office of the Crown Prince s Palace </s>
<s> Although this was a minor post in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career </s>
<s> Even before he had begun work however the position was swept away by events </s>
<s> War The An unk Rebellion began in December unk and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years </s>
<s> It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society the census of recorded </s>
<s> million people but ten years later the census counted just </s>
<s> million the remainder having been displaced or killed </s>
<s> During this time Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unk by wars associated unk and imperial unk </s>
<s> This period of unk was the making of Du Fu as a poet Even Shan Chou has written that What he saw around him the lives of his family neighbors and strangers what he heard and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns these became the enduring themes of his poetry </s>
<s> Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own unk </s>
<s> Du Fu wrote unk on what I have lived through if even I know such suffering the common man must surely be unk by the winds </s>
<s> In unk Emperor unk was forced to flee the capital and unk </s>
<s> Du Fu who had been away from the city took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor unk but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang an </s>
<s> In the autumn his youngest son Du unk Baby Bear was born </s>
<s> Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria </s>
<s> He escaped from Chang an the following year and was appointed unk when he rejoined the court in May unk </s>
<s> This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial </s>
<s> Du Fu s unk compelled him to try to make use of it he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge </s>
<s> He was arrested but was unk in June </s>
<s> He was granted leave to visit his family in September but he soon rejoined the court and on December unk he returned to Chang an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces </s>
<s> However his advice continued to be unk and in the summer of unk he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in unk </s>
<s> The position was not to his taste in one poem he wrote I am about to scream unk in the office Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk </s>
<s> He moved on in the summer of unk this has traditionally been ascribed to famine but unk believes that frustration is a more likely reason </s>
<s> He next spent around six weeks in unk now unk Gansu province where he wrote more than sixty poems </s>
<s> unk In December unk he briefly stayed in unk modern Gansu </s>
<s> He departed on December for unk Sichuan province where he was hosted by local unk and fellow poet unk Di </s>
<s> Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years </s>
<s> By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble and sent poems unk help to various acquaintances </s>
<s> He was relieved by Yan Wu a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at unk </s>
<s> Despite his financial problems this was one of the unk and most peaceful periods of his life </s>
<s> Many of Du s poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at unk unk </s>
<s> In he left the city to escape a rebellion but he returned in summer unk when he was appointed an advisor to Yan who was involved in campaigns against the unk Empire </s>
<s> Last years Luoyang the region of his birthplace was recovered by government forces in the winter of and in the spring of unk Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze apparently with the intention of making their way there </s>
<s> They traveled slowly held up by his ill health by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight unk and general old age in addition to his previous unk </s>
<s> They stayed in unk in what is now unk unk at the entrance to the Three unk for almost two years from late spring unk </s>
<s> This period was Du Fu s last great poetic flowering and here he wrote poems in his dense late style </s>
<s> In autumn unk Bo unk became governor of the region he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary </s>
<s> In March unk he began his journey again and got as far as unk province where he died in unk now unk in November or December in his unk year </s>
<s> He was survived by his wife and two sons who remained in the area for some years at least </s>
<s> His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan unk in unk </s>
<s> unk unk his life by concluding that He appeared to be a unk son an affectionate father a generous brother a faithful husband a loyal friend a unk official and a patriotic subject </s>
<s> Below is an example of one of Du Fu s later works To My unk Friend unk Chinese unk </s>
<s> Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces Works Criticism of Du Fu s works has focused on his strong sense of history his moral engagement and his technical excellence </s>
<s> History Since the Song dynasty critics have called Du Fu the poet historian unk unk unk </s>
<s> The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor </s>
<s> unk he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself and on the ordinary people of China </s>
<s> As Watson notes this is information of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era </s>
<s> Du Fu s political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation his unk have been unk as Let us all be less selfish let us all do what we are supposed to do </s>
<s> Since his views were impossible to disagree with his unk expressed unk enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history </s>
<s> unk engagement A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of poet sage unk unk unk a counterpart to the philosophical sage unk </s>
<s> One of the earliest surviving works The Song of the unk from around gives voice to the unk of a unk soldier in the imperial army and a clear sighted consciousness of suffering </s>
<s> These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life </s>
<s> Although Du Fu s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all consuming unk Hawkes argues that his famous compassion in fact includes himself viewed quite unk and almost as an unk </s>
<s> He therefore lends grandeur to the wider picture by comparing it to his own slightly comical triviality </s>
<s> Du Fu s compassion for himself and for others was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment </s>
<s> Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu everything in this world is poetry Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life calligraphy paintings animals and other poems </s>
<s> Technical excellence Du Fu s work is notable above all for its range </s>
<s> Chinese critics traditionally used the term unk unk complete unk a reference to unk description of unk </s>
<s> Yuan unk was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu s achievement writing in unk that his predecessor united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly </s>
<s> He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry Chou says that in every form he either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples </s>
<s> Furthermore his poems use a wide range of registers from the direct and unk to the unk and self consciously literary </s>
<s> This variety is unk even within individual works Owen identifies the rapid stylistic and thematic shifts in poems which enable the poet to represent different unk of a situation while Chou uses the term juxtaposition as the major analytical tool in her work </s>
<s> Du Fu is noted for having written more on unk and painting than any other writer of his time </s>
<s> He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone more than any other Tang poet </s>
<s> Du Fu s seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han unk unk a controversy that has persisted to the present day </s>
<s> The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings unk like according to Watson his earliest works are in a relatively derivative courtly style but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion </s>
<s> Owen comments on the unk simplicity of the unk poems which mirrors the desert landscape the works from his unk period are light often finely observed while the poems from the late unk period have a density and power of vision </s>
<s> Although he wrote in all poetic forms Du Fu is best known for his unk a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content for example About two thirds of Du Fu s extant works are in this form and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent </s>
<s> His best unk use the unk required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions </s>
<s> Hawkes comments that it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner </s>
<s> Influence According to the unk Britannica Du Fu s writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time and it states his dense compressed language makes use of all the unk overtones of a phrase and of all the unk unk of the individual word qualities that no translation can ever reveal </s>
<s> In his lifetime and immediately following his death Du Fu was not greatly appreciated </s>
<s> In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations some of which are still considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics </s>
<s> There are few contemporary references to him only eleven poems from six writers and these describe him in terms of affection but not as a unk of poetic or moral ideals </s>
<s> Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry </s>
<s> However as unk notes he is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century </s>
<s> Early positive comments came from unk unk who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu s works although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems and from Han Yu who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li unk on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them </s>
<s> Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work </s>
<s> By the beginning of the century unk unk constructed the first replica of his unk cottage in Sichuan </s>
<s> It was in the century during the Northern Song era that Du Fu s reputation reached its peak </s>
<s> In this period a comprehensive re evaluation of earlier poets took place in which Wang unk Li unk and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist unk and Confucian strands of Chinese culture </s>
<s> At the same time the development of Neo unk ensured that Du Fu as its poetic unk occupied the paramount position </s>
<s> Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was unk because through all his unk he never for the space of a meal unk his sovereign </s>
<s> His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites political unk were attracted by his loyalty to the established order while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor </s>
<s> Literary unk could look to his technical mastery while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations </s>
<s> Since the establishment of the People s Republic of China Du Fu s loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism and he has been praised for his use of simple people s language </s>
<s> Du Fu s popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him </s>
<s> While there was never another Du Fu individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work unk unk s concern for the poor Lu You s patriotism and unk unk s unk on the unk are a few examples </s>
<s> More broadly Du Fu s work in transforming the unk from mere word play into a vehicle for serious poetic unk set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre </s>
<s> In the century he was the favourite poet of Kenneth unk who has described him as the greatest non epic non dramatic poet who has survived in any language and commented that he has made me a better man as a moral agent and as a unk organism </s>
<s> Influence on Japanese literature Du Fu s poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature especially on the literature from the unk period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period including unk unk the very greatest of all unk poets </s>
<s> Even in modern Japanese the term Saint of Poetry unk unk is mostly synonymous with Du Fu </s>
<s> Until the century the Japanese preferred unk unk above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu although his influence can be seen in some unk Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets anthologies such as unk unk in the century </s>
<s> The first notable Japanese unk of Du Fu s poetry was unk unk unk unk a unk unk patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a unk priest in Vol </s>
<s> of unk </s>
<s> His student unk unk composed many unk which were clearly stated influenced by Du Fu in their unk </s>
<s> unk s student unk unk had close connection with the Court and unk unk and unk Du Fu s poetry in the mundane world one day unk unk the unk regent of the Court and the highest authority of unk poetry asked unk Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li unk </s>
<s> unk unk to reply Yes if you do have enough capability </s>
<s> No if do not </s>
<s> Since then there had been many unk on Du Fu s poetry both in unk temples and in the aristocratic society and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the unk period eg </s>
<s> unk a historical epic in the late century and some unk plays such as unk unk and unk </s>
<s> During the Kan unk era of the Edo period unk unk unk of the Ming Dynasty s unk unk on Du Fu s unk unk unk unk was imported into Japan and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and unk unk class </s>
<s> The commentary established Du Fu s fame as the highest of all poets for instance unk unk a notable Confucian scholar commented in Vol </s>
<s> of unk unk that unk Du Fu was the very best poet in history and praised unk unk s commentary for its simplicity and readability while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unk </s>
<s> unk unk the greatest unk poet was also strongly influenced by Du Fu in unk no unk his masterpiece he cites the first two lines of A Spring View unk before a unk as its introduction and also many of his other unk have similar wording and themes </s>
<s> It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel a copy of Du Fu s poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around </s>
<s> unk A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu s work into English </s>
<s> As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu which is why we need as many different translations as possible unk unk </s>
<s> The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding unk to a Western ear particularly when translating regulated verse or unk and unk the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works Hawkes writes that his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation unk unk </s>
<s> One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth unk s One Hundred Poems From the Chinese </s>
<s> His are free translations which seek to conceal the unk through unk and expansion and contraction of the content his responses to the allusions are firstly to unk most of these poems from his selection and unk to translate out the references in those works which he does select </s>
<s> Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu </s>
<s> Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English style rhyme schemes whereas Keith unk in Facing the Moon unk the Chinese rhyme scheme both use end stopped lines and preserve some degree of unk </s>
<s> In The Selected Poems of Du Fu Burton Watson follows the unk quite strictly persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa </s>
<s> Similarly he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive unk </s>
<s> In Stephen Owen published translations with facing Chinese texts of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes with extensive scholarly apparatus which emphasized unk </s>

<s> After the war they were scrapped in </s>
<s> Background The design of the unk class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters </s>
<s> The unk s fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in the last year of the Russo Japanese War which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of unk </s>
<s> In the aftermath the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean Britain and the United States </s>
<s> unk unk a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals </s>
<s> To that end he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least as many capital ships as the US Navy </s>
<s> This ratio unk theorized would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict </s>
<s> Accordingly the Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships long tons t each and eight modern armoured cruisers long tons unk t each </s>

<s> While unk was laid down later that year the unk lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of unk and unk until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July </s>
<s> Design and description The progress of unk s construction while the unk waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments caused the unk to unk the unk class design </s>
<s> The distribution of the unk gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the unk magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired </s>
<s> Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the </s>

<s> lb shells used in the manually loaded millimetre in secondary guns used in the unk class and earlier designs </s>
<s> To resolve this issue the unk designed a smaller millimetre </s>
<s> in gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire </s>
<s> It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth class battleships and Russian unk class battlecruisers </s>

<s> After the First Battle of unk unk the US Army s Infantry Division was moved to defend the unk River line </s>
<s> The division which was unk in combat was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People s Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division s line </s>
<s> The force of the attack split the US Infantry Division in half and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to unk promoting a fight there </s>

<s> In two weeks of heavy fighting the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the unk unk region </s>
<s> The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at unk which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army </s>
<s> Background Pusan Perimeter From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North the North Korean People s Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing </s>
<s> The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively attacking from the front and initiating a double unk of both flanks of the unit which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force which would then be forced to retreat in unk often leaving behind much of its equipment </s>
<s> From their initial June offensive to fights in July and early August the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south </s>
<s> However when the UN forces under the Eighth United States Army established the Pusan Perimeter in August the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army </s>
<s> When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter </s>
<s> Throughout August the unk Division and later the unk Division engaged the US Infantry Division at the Battle of unk initially unk a UN counteroffensive before unk with battles at unk unk and Battle Mountain </s>

<s> All along the front the North Korean troops were unk from these defeats the first time in the war their strategies were not working </s>
<s> September push In planning its new offensive the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy </s>
<s> Instead they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle </s>
<s> unk by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle </s>
<s> A secondary objective was to surround unk and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city </s>
<s> As part of this mission the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to unk </s>
<s> On August the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units </s>
<s> The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five unk attack against the UN lines </s>

<s> During the last week of August US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the unk against a possible American attack </s>
<s> There were occasional attacks on the Infantry s forward positions but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action </s>
<s> On August the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines </s>
<s> Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming </s>
<s> On the west side of the unk North Korean Major General unk unk Sam commanding the unk Division issued his operations order to the division on August </s>
<s> Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at unk unk by capturing the unk and unk areas to cut off the US Division s route of supply and withdrawal between unk and Pusan </s>
<s> However the North Koreans weren t aware that the US Infantry Division had recently replaced the US Infantry Division in positions along the unk River </s>

<s> It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains splitting the US Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing unk where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces supply lines and threatening other divisions rear areas </s>
<s> However once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success its communications and supply were not capable of unk a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air armor and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points </s>

<s> The rapid evolution of warship design in the late century transformed the ironclad from a wooden unk vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel built unk battleships and cruisers familiar in the century </s>
<s> This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns the ironclads of the carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea more sophisticated steam engines and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible </s>
<s> The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished and that naval tactics were in a state of flux </s>

<s> There is no clear end to the ironclad period but towards the end of the the term ironclad dropped out of use </s>
<s> New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers </s>
<s> The ironclad The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the century </s>
<s> According to naval historian J Richard Hill The ironclad had three chief characteristics a metal skinned hull steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells </s>
<s> It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad </s>
<s> Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads </s>
<s> Steam propulsion In the and early centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship the ship of the line and the frigate </s>

<s> Steam powered screw frigates were built in the mid and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle </s>
<s> The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe which required a challenge to the British at sea </s>

<s> Then the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French unk Henri Joseph unk and by the were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy Royal Navy Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy </s>
<s> It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of unk spelled the end of the wooden unk warship </s>
<s> The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red hot shot which could unk in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion </s>
<s> Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power </s>
<s> Iron armor The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships hulls began in the the first warship with an iron hull was the gunboat unk built by Laird for the East India Company in </s>
<s> There followed also from Laird the first full blown warships with metal hulls the steam frigates unk and unk for the Mexican navy </s>
<s> But a thin iron skin while not being susceptible to fire or lethal unk like wood was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire </s>
<s> Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of unk and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the unk guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light draft floating batteries equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor </s>
<s> Experiments made during the first half of proved highly satisfactory and on July the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun proof vessels and that plans would be communicated </s>

<s> The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their unk </s>
<s> Early ironclad ships and battles By the end of the it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required </s>

<s> However the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France and involved ships markedly different from the broadside firing unk designs of Gloire and Warrior </s>
<s> The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of unk had an important influence on the development of ironclad design </s>
<s> First battles between ironclads the US Civil War The first use of ironclads in action came in the US Civil War </s>
<s> The US Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads its most powerful ships being six steam powered unk frigates </s>
<s> Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships </s>

<s> On October the CSS unk became the first ironclad to enter combat when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of unk </s>

<s> The Union was also building a large armored frigate the USS New unk and the smaller USS unk </s>
<s> The first battle between ironclads happened on March as the armored unk was deployed to protect the Union s wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships </s>
<s> In this engagement the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor </s>

<s> If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs some more successful or disastrous than others confirmed the emerging trade off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture ship construction and gun design to name a few also going on in Europe </s>
<s> There was no such thing as a perfect ironclad which could be unk in every possible encounter ship duels standing up to forts Brown Blue water operations </s>

<s> unk First fleet battle The first fleet battle and the first ocean battle involving ironclad warships was the Battle of unk in </s>
<s> unk between the Austrian and Italian navies the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and unk and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of unk and unk </s>
<s> The Italian fleet consisted of ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of unk </s>
<s> Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates four smaller ironclads and the newly built unk a double unk ram </s>
<s> unk them the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates </s>
<s> The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them </s>
<s> The Austrian fleet formed into an unk formation with the ironclads in the first line charging at the Italian ironclad squadron </s>
<s> In the unk which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns and by the difficulty of unk nonetheless the effective unk attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years </s>
<s> The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads Re d Italia and Palestro while the Austrian unk screw two unk SMS Kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads </s>
<s> The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic </s>
<s> The battles of the American Civil War and at unk were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed </s>
<s> In particular it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that unk was the best way to sink enemy ironclads </s>
<s> Armament and tactics The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless since their shot would bounce off an armored hull </s>
<s> To penetrate armor increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships nevertheless the view that unk was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread </s>
<s> The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside in the manner of a ship of the line towards a handful of guns in turrets for all round fire </s>
<s> Ram craze From the to the many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare </s>
<s> With steam power freeing ships from the wind and armor making them unk to unk the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow </s>
<s> The unk damage inflicted by the guns of unk and Virginia at Battle of Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d Italia at unk gave strength to the unk craze </s>
<s> From the early to early most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram </s>
<s> Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by unk struggled to be heard </s>
<s> The revival of unk had a significant effect on naval tactics </s>
<s> Since the century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns </s>
<s> This tactic was totally unsuited to unk and the ram threw fleet tactics into unk </s>
<s> The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle and if it had been combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water </s>
<s> The ram finally fell out of favour in the as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo with less vulnerability to quick firing guns </s>
<s> Development of naval guns The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration </s>
<s> Throughout the ironclad era navies also unk with the unk of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech loading versus muzzle loading </s>
<s> HMS Warrior carried a mixture of pounder inch mm breech loading rifles and more traditional pounder smoothbore guns </s>
<s> Warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament the breech unk she carried designed by Sir William Armstrong were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy but were shortly withdrawn from service </s>
<s> unk loading guns seemed to offer important advantages </s>
<s> A breech unk could be unk without moving the gun a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re aimed </s>
<s> The Warrior s Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and because of their unk more accurate </s>
<s> Nonetheless the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech unk for decades </s>
<s> The weakness of the breech unk was the obvious problem of sealing the breech </s>
<s> All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas </s>
<s> This explosion unk the shot or shell out of the front of the gun but also unk great stresses on the gun barrel </s>
<s> If the breech which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun is not entirely secure then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break </s>
<s> This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew </s>
<s> The Warrior s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems the shells were unable to penetrate the </s>
<s> in mm armor of Gloire while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing </s>
<s> Similar problems were experienced with the breech loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies </s>
<s> These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle loading weapons of increasing power until the </s>
<s> After a brief introduction of pounder or </s>
<s> inch mm smoothbore Somerset Gun which weighed </s>
<s> tons </s>
<s> t the Admiralty introduced inch mm rifled guns weighing tons </s>
<s> These were followed by a series of increasingly unk weapons guns weighing and finally tons with calibre increasing from inch mm to inch mm </s>
<s> The decision to retain muzzle unk until the has been criticised by historians </s>
<s> However at least until the late the British muzzle unk had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech unk which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns </s>
<s> From onwards the balance between unk and muzzle loading changed </s>
<s> Captain de unk invented a method of reliably sealing a breech adopted by the French in </s>
<s> Just as unk the growing size of naval guns made muzzle loading much more complicated </s>
<s> With guns of such size there was no prospect of unk in the gun for re loading or even re loading by hand and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire </s>
<s> In the ton inch mm guns of HMS unk fired only once every minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the unk unk </s>
<s> The ton mm </s>
<s> inch guns of unk unk could each fire a round every minutes </s>
<s> In the Royal Navy the switch to breech unk was finally made in as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance opinion was unk by an explosion on board HMS unk caused by a gun being double loaded a problem which could only happen with a muzzle loading gun </s>
<s> The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far </s>
<s> The larger the gun the slower it would be to load the greater the stresses on the ship s hull and the less the stability of the ship </s>
<s> The size of the gun peaked in the with some of the heaviest unk of gun ever used at sea </s>
<s> HMS unk carried two </s>
<s> inch unk mm breech loading guns each weighing tons no British battleship would ever carry guns as large </s>
<s> The Italian mm </s>
<s> inch guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the </s>
<s> inch mm armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II </s>
<s> One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models following the Crimean War range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as floating weapons platform could unk the advantage of unk </s>
<s> American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least unk along the surface of the water </s>
<s> unk effective combat ranges they had learned during the Civil War were comparable to those in the Age of unk though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds </s>
<s> Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem </s>
<s> As a result many naval engagements in the Age of the unk were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets and well below the maximum reach of their ships guns </s>
<s> Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the unk fired or the nature of the propellant </s>
<s> Early ironclads used black powder which expanded rapidly after combustion this meant cannons had relatively short barrels to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell </s>
<s> The unk of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress </s>
<s> One important step was to press the powder into unk allowing a slower more controlled explosion and a longer barrel </s>
<s> A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which unk more slowly again </s>
<s> It also put less stress on the unk of the barrel allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to unk unk </s>
<s> The development of unk powder based on unk or unk by the French inventor Paul unk in was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels </s>
<s> The guns of the pre unk battleships of the tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the most often in mm but progressively grew in length of barrel making use of improved unk to gain greater muzzle velocity </s>
<s> The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period </s>
<s> Initially the best armor piercing unk was a solid cast iron shot </s>
<s> Later shot of unk iron a harder iron alloy gave better armor piercing qualities </s>
<s> Eventually the armor piercing shell was developed </s>
<s> unk of armament unk ironclads The first British French and Russian ironclads in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called broadside ironclads </s>
<s> Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type </s>
<s> Because their armor was so heavy they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck </s>
<s> A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the principally in Britain and France but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy Austria Russia and the United States </s>
<s> The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one unk at a time and the rigging did not impede the field of fire </s>
<s> unk armament also had disadvantages which became more serious as ironclad technology developed </s>
<s> unk guns to penetrate ever thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried </s>
<s> Furthermore the adoption of unk as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all round fire </s>
<s> These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all round fire which included central battery turret and barbette designs </s>
<s> unk batteries and barbettes There were two main design unk to the broadside </s>
<s> In one design the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships this arrangement was called the box battery or centre battery </s>
<s> In the other the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire when fully armored this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unk a barbette </s>
<s> The centre battery was the simpler and during the and the more popular method </s>
<s> unk guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and unk than a broadside type </s>
<s> The first full scale centre battery ship was HMS Bellerophon of the French laid down centre battery ironclads in which were not completed until </s>
<s> Centre battery ships often but not always had a unk unk enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead </s>
<s> The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS unk in with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson </s>
<s> A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor unk unk with a prototype of this installed on HMS unk in for testing and evaluation purposes </s>
<s> Ericsson s turret turned on a central spindle and unk s turned on a ring of bearings </s>
<s> unk offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns but there were significant problems with their use in the </s>
<s> The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean going ironclads </s>
<s> The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy </s>
<s> Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret guns and armour protection by deliberately designing a ship with very low unk </s>
<s> The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour </s>
<s> Low unk however also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage and therefore range of the vessel </s>
<s> In many respects the unk low unk unk and the broadside unk HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an unk was all about </s>
<s> The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes or unk this circle was designed by Captain unk unk unk HMS Captain a dangerously low unk turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in </s>
<s> Her half sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams </s>
<s> The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS unk of which carried two turrets on either side of the centre line allowing both to fire fore aft and broadside </s>
<s> A lighter alternative to the turret particularly popular with the French navy was the barbette </s>
<s> These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a unk </s>
<s> The crew was sheltered from direct fire but vulnerable to unk fire for instance from shore emplacements </s>
<s> The barbette was lighter than the turret needing less machinery and no roof armor though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top weight of their ships </s>
<s> The barbette became widely adopted in the and with the addition of an armored gun house transformed into the turrets of the pre unk battleships </s>
<s> unk The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons which helped unk the design and tactics of ironclad fleets </s>
<s> The first torpedoes were static mines used extensively in the American Civil War </s>
<s> That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat </s>
<s> For the first time a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one and given the relative unk of unk against ironclads the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously </s>
<s> The US Navy converted four of its monitors to become unk armored spar torpedo vessels while under construction in but these vessels never saw action </s>
<s> Another proposal the towed or Harvey torpedo involved an explosive on a line or unk either to deter a ship from unk or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less unk </s>
<s> A more practical and influential weapon was the self propelled or Whitehead torpedo </s>
<s> unk in and deployed in the the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the like HMS unk and the Italian unk unk and Enrico unk </s>
<s> The ironclad s vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the unk unk school of naval thought it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo </s>
<s> In practice however the unk unk was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads </s>
<s> Armor and construction The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden unk </s>
<s> unk were still being built with wooden hulls into the </s>
<s> unk iron wood and steel Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull </s>
<s> However unk iron had many military disadvantages and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years particularly for long range cruising warships </s>
<s> Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the </s>
<s> In the and France Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron unk but unk gunboats and frigates </s>
<s> However the iron unk frigate was abandoned by the end of the because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot iron was more brittle than wood and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood </s>
<s> The unk of unk iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor </s>
<s> However iron gave the naval architect many advantages </s>
<s> Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design for instance the use of unk bulkheads on the lower decks </s>
<s> Warrior built of iron was longer and faster than the wooden unk Gloire </s>
<s> Iron could be produced to order and used immediately in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of unk </s>
<s> And given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron iron hulls were increasingly cost effective </s>
<s> The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the was that the French iron industry could not supply enough and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden unk ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought </s>
<s> Wooden hulls continued to be used for long range and smaller ironclads because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage </s>
<s> Iron hulls suffered quick unk by marine life slowing the ships down unk for a European unk close to dry docks but a difficulty for long range ships </s>
<s> The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive </s>
<s> Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable the Japanese unk and unk ordered in were sister ships but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction </s>
<s> After steel started to be introduced as a material for construction </s>
<s> Compared to iron steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight </s>
<s> The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet starting with the unk laid down in and launched in </s>
<s> unk nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel </s>
<s> Even though Britain led the world in steel production the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships </s>
<s> The unk process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large scale use on ships </s>
<s> French manufacturers used the unk Martin process to produce adequate steel but British technology unk behind </s>

<s> Steel was also an obvious material for armor </s>
<s> It was tested in the but the steel of the time was too brittle and unk when struck by shells </s>

<s> The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately with licenses being given for the use of the Wilson System of producing fused armor </s>

<s> The French navy decided in to adopt compound armor for its fleet but found it limited in supply so from the French navy was using steel armor </s>

<s> The British HMS unk started in was the first large ocean going ironclad to unk with masts </s>
<s> Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean </s>
<s> The unk and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the were the exception rather than the rule </s>
<s> Most ironclads of the retained masts and only the Italian navy which during that decade was focused on short range operations in the Adriatic built consistently unk ironclads </s>
<s> During the steam engines improved with the adoption of double expansion steam engines which used less coal than earlier models </s>
<s> The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double expansion engine in and by they were widespread </s>
<s> However this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast </s>
<s> Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation is a matter of debate </s>
<s> A steam only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands </s>
<s> Just as significantly because of unk problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines the performance of double expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory </s>

<s> Fleets While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads </s>
<s> Most European nations settled differences on land and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France while providing suitable protection to Britain s commerce and colonial outposts worldwide </s>
<s> unk remained for the British Royal Navy a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second </s>
<s> Those naval engagements of the latter half of the century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second rate naval powers </s>
<s> But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy makers of the increasing unk of strictly naval foreign intervention from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the unk combined defences of naval unk such as unk and Cherbourg </s>

<s> The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles </s>
<s> In the age of sail the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy </s>
<s> Because of the limited endurance of unk this was no longer possible so the British at times considered the risk laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out </s>
<s> To this end the Royal Navy developed a series of coast defence battleships starting with the unk class </s>
<s> These unk monitors were markedly different from the other high seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship </s>
<s> As long range monitors they could reach Bermuda unk for example </s>
<s> However they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions and enemy monitors as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War </s>
<s> The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of unk by the close of the Crimean War but never considered running the smoke ridden shallow water gauntlet straight to St Petersburg with ironclads </s>
<s> Likewise monitors proved unk unable to overwhelm enemy fortifications single handed during the American conflict though their low profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running unk </s>

<s> The title refers to a small Anglican community in unk established by Nicholas unk in the century and scattered during the English Civil War </s>
<s> The poem uses the combined image of fire and unk fire to emphasise the need for purification and unk </s>
<s> According to the poet humanity s flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare but this can be overcome by unk the lessons of the past </s>
<s> Within the poem the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures </s>
<s> Little unk focuses on the unity of past present and future and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation </s>
<s> Background Following the completion of the third Four unk poem The Dry unk Eliot s health declined and he stayed in unk Green Surrey while he recovered </s>
<s> During this time Eliot started writing Little unk </s>
<s> The first draft was completed in July but he was dissatisfied with it </s>
<s> He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write and that precipitated by air raids on London he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly </s>
<s> After the first draft was written he set the poem aside and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain </s>
<s> After months of not working on the poem Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it it was not until August however that he started working on it again </s>
<s> In total there were five drafts </s>
<s> The poem was finished by September and published in the October New English Weekly </s>
<s> Little unk was intended to conclude the Four unk series unk Eliot s views expressed in this series of poems </s>
<s> Little unk was the home of an Anglican community established in unk by Nicholas unk </s>
<s> The unk household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer </s>
<s> The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War between unk and unk but reformed ending with the death of John unk in unk </s>
<s> Eliot had visited the site in May </s>
<s> Unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the Four unk poems Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community </s>
<s> As such the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community </s>
<s> Poem Critics classify Little unk as a poem of fire with an emphasis on unk and the unk fire </s>
<s> The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter with attention paid to the arrival of summer </s>
<s> The images of snow which provoke desires for a spiritual life transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire earth air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four </s>
<s> Following this is a discussion on death and destruction things unk and regret for past events </s>
<s> While using Dante s unk unk style the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain </s>
<s> The image of warfare unk with the depiction of unk and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air raids on London </s>
<s> In the second section a ghost representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds begins talking to the narrator of the poem </s>
<s> The ghost discusses change art in general and how humankind is flawed </s>
<s> The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity according to the ghost is to experience unk through fire </s>
<s> The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich s writing about God s love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of unk a shirt that burns its wearer </s>
<s> Little unk continues by describing the unk of the present and how history exists in a pattern </s>
<s> The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn and that salvation should be the goal of humankind </s>
<s> Themes In terms of renewal Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin </s>
<s> The original Little unk community was built for living on monastic lines but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in </s>
<s> The church the centre of the community was restored in and again in </s>
<s> The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world </s>
<s> This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit unk communion with the dead and the repetition of history </s>
<s> The theme is also internal to Eliot s own poems the image of the rose garden at the end Little unk is the image that begins unk Norton and the journey is made circular </s>
<s> Also the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family unk </s>
<s> Like the other poems making up the Four unk Little unk deals with the past present and future and humanity s place within them as each generation is seemingly united </s>
<s> In the second section there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets including Dante Swift Yeats and others </s>
<s> When the ghost joins the poet the narrator states Knowing myself yet being someone other </s>
<s> This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge allowing a communication and connection with the dead </s>
<s> Later in the fourth section humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London redemption or destruction </s>
<s> God s love allows humankind to be unk and escape the living hell through unk by fire </s>
<s> The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet </s>
<s> He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society </s>
<s> The ghost a combination of many literary figures was originally addressed in the poem as unk unk before being revised as an ambiguous you </s>
<s> unk unk was Dante s way of addressing unk unk a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for unk </s>
<s> Eliot in a letter to John unk dated August explained why he changed the wording I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of unk for two reasons </s>
<s> The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that </s>
<s> However I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to unk to him the particular vice which took unk there </s>
<s> unk although the reference to that unk is intended to be explicit I wish the effect of the whole to be unk which is more appropriate </s>
<s> That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of unk where the poets are found </s>
<s> The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of unk unk a poet that influenced Dante seeking such a state in unk unk </s>
<s> However the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing an act that appears throughout Yeats s poetry within unk flames </s>
<s> The critic Dominic unk suggests that in combining the image of dancing with unk Eliot unk Dante s and Yeats s poetic themes </s>
<s> Reception Critics such as Malcolm unk and unk unk describe mixed emotions about the unk of the poem </s>
<s> unk emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than unk while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages </s>
<s> unk also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little unk </s>
<s> F B </s>
<s> unk believed that the fourth section of the poem costs Eliot more trouble and unk than any passage of the same length he ever wrote and is his greatest achievement in the Four unk </s>
<s> E M Forster did not like Eliot s emphasis on pain and responded to the poem Of course there s pain on and off through each individual s life You can t unk it and so on </s>
<s> But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and unk by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and unk </s>
<s> It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer </s>

<s> The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood early unk unk would have had difficulty unk carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem </s>
<s> Many unk also have canal like grooves in their skulls called sensory unk </s>
<s> The unk which usually run around the nostrils and eye unk are part of a lateral line system used to detect unk in water </s>
<s> As unk animals most unk have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot </s>

<s> unk unk to small unk have also been found in unk and unk rocks </s>
<s> The unk called unk are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments suggesting the animals had some ties to the water </s>
<s> Unlike modern amphibians many unk are covered in small closely packed scales </s>

<s> In living unk the main body of the unk is a single piece of bone called the unk but in unk this region was divided into a unk and unk </s>
<s> Two types of vertebrae are recognized in unk unk and unk vertebrae </s>

<s> A third hypothesis is that unk descended from unk and frogs and unk evolved from unk </s>
<s> Recently the theory that unk were the ancestors of all unk has gained wide support </s>
<s> The skull morphology of some small unk has been compared to those of modern frogs and unk but the presence of unk unk teeth in small unk or immature unk has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the unk origin of unk </s>

<s> In an unk called unk unk was named from Texas and was nicknamed the unk for its frog like head and unk like body </s>
<s> It was thought to be the most closely related unk to unk and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis </s>
<s> Another species of unk called unk unk is now thought to be even more closely related to unk </s>
<s> Unlike unk unk was known since and the presence of unk teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians </s>
<s> It was first described as a unk and the specific name unk means connecting in reference to its inferred transitional position between unk and unk </s>
<s> The structure of its unk a disk like membrane that functions like an ear drum is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship </s>
<s> Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull the short ribs and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of unk than is unk </s>
<s> Below is a cladogram modified from unk and unk showing the relationships of unk unk and unk unk Feeding Although the earliest unk were primarily unk they had the ability to feed on land </s>
<s> Later unk and unk some well adapted to terrestrial life also fed on land </s>
<s> Some unk became better adapted toward life in water and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms </s>
<s> The first primarily aquatic unk were unk in the unk </s>
<s> unk and unk became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding </s>
<s> Most aquatic unk have flattened heads </s>
<s> When feeding they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws </s>

<s> unk is thought to have lifted its skull to around above horizontal through the unk of the unk unk joint between the unk unk of the skull and the unk unk of the neck </s>
<s> As the skull is raised the unk bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to unk outward </s>
<s> Other unk probably also lifted their skulls but they are not as well adapted for such movement </s>
<s> unk Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in unk </s>
<s> He envisioned that unk a much larger unk than unk was able to make the same movement </s>
<s> unk unk unk also supported the idea in suggesting that unk also fed in this way </s>
<s> At the time it was thought that these unk lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral unk </s>
<s> unk a close relative of unk also has a unk skeleton that muscles may have attached to </s>
<s> unk has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull suggesting that it could unk feed by rapidly opening its mouth </s>
<s> Unlike unk unk terrestrial unk have skulls that are adapted for biting land living prey </s>
<s> The unk between the bones of the skull in the unk unk are able to withstand a high degree of compression </s>
<s> unk forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey </s>
<s> Earlier aquatic unk and unk ancestors differ from unk like unk in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension </s>
<s> This tension would have been experienced during unk feeding underwater </s>
<s> unk like unk were among the first unk that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting </s>
<s> Reproduction unk like all amphibians reproduced in aquatic environments </s>
<s> Most unk probably reproduced through external fertilization </s>
<s> Like most living frogs female unk would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to unk them </s>
<s> Several fossils were described from the Early unk of Texas in that may be egg masses of unk unk </s>
<s> They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs </s>
<s> The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably unk membranes and unk like areas surrounding them that are most likely unk coatings </s>
<s> They are attached to plant fossils suggesting that these unk laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs </s>
<s> The unk membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians not fish their eggs lack unk but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs </s>
<s> The eggs are thought to be from unk because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians and probably had similar reproductive strategies </s>
<s> They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found </s>
<s> One unk the unk unk may have unk young in an area between the gills called the unk unk </s>
<s> Small bones belonging to younger unk individuals have been found in these pouches </s>
<s> The living Darwin s Frog is also a mouth unk and would be the closest modern unk to unk if it cared for its young in this way </s>
<s> An alternative possibility is that unk was unk eating its young like many amphibians do today </s>
<s> If this was the case the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the unk unk as the animal unk </s>
<s> Body impressions of Early unk unk from Pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial unk mated on land like some modern amphibians </s>
<s> They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water </s>
<s> The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the unk were gregarious </s>
<s> The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display </s>
<s> Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern unk </s>
<s> Growth While most types of unk are distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens several are known from juvenile and unk specimens </s>
<s> unk is seen in unk unk and unk with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land </s>
<s> Several types of unk do not fully unk but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as unk </s>
<s> unk and the unk unk were also unk because they retained gills but they are only known from adult specimens </s>
<s> unk larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a unk apparatus a series of bones that gills would attach to in life </s>
<s> However some fully mature unk also possess unk bones but did not have external gills </s>
<s> A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults </s>
<s> Major body changes occur in unk including the unk and strengthening of skull bones the unk of unk bones and an increase in body size </s>
<s> unk like unk are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae showing an extreme change in body shape </s>
<s> In these species the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development </s>
<s> The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time </s>
<s> Small regularly spaced pits are the first to form followed by larger ridges </s>
<s> As development continues the external gills disappear </s>
<s> Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost </s>
<s> The unk skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull with ossification the replacement of cartilage by bone happening more slowly </s>
<s> unk and limb bones are poorly developed ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages and the unk and unk are entirely absent through most of development </s>
<s> Once maturity is reached most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows </s>
<s> The bones of some unk like unk show growth marks possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons </s>
<s> unk of unk like unk and unk show that individuals grew larger past maturity </s>
<s> The oldest individuals usually have more unk on their skulls with deeper unk </s>
<s> One group of unk the unk is also known from unk specimens </s>
<s> unk like unk and unk are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills </s>
<s> An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens but the lack of unk adapted adult forms suggests that these unk were unk </s>
<s> Unlike other unk their unk skeletons developed quickly but were still partly unk when fully mature </s>
<s> Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles </s>
<s> Recently large specimens of unk unk were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle indicating that not all unk were unk </s>
<s> While most unk are aquatic in early stages of life most unk appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage </s>
<s> Like other unk unk adult unk were adapted to a unk lifestyle </s>
<s> Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land </s>
<s> The cross unk thickness of limb bones in adult unk shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial unk </s>
<s> unk individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress and could probably move about on land </s>
<s> To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle a unk s limb bones would have to unk with positive unk meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body </s>
<s> This is not the case in unk meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle </s>
<s> unk unk and other early unk have rounded unk unk in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region </s>
<s> In life the unk notch would have been covered by a membrane called the unk which is seen as a disk like area in living frogs </s>
<s> The unk is involved in hearing and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced unk </s>
<s> It was traditionally thought that the unk developed very early in unk evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of unk </s>
<s> Thus unk possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles </s>

<s> Evolution of the method The initial development of this technique occurred in by Vernon Dvorak using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific ocean </s>
<s> The system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model </s>
<s> As the technique matured through the and measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone s low pressure area </s>
<s> Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself </s>
<s> unk on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the and </s>
<s> The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification as the original estimates were hPa </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> inHg too low in the Atlantic and up to hPa </s>
<s> inHg too high in the northwest Pacific </s>
<s> This led to the development of a separate wind pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific devised by Atkinson and Holliday in then modified in </s>
<s> As human analysts using the technique lead to unk biases efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs which have been aided by higher resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers </s>
<s> Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can unk over time automated techniques use a six hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates </s>
<s> Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes of hurricane or typhoon strength </s>
<s> It still required a manual center placement keeping some unk within the process </s>
<s> By an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to unk determine the tropical cyclone s center </s>
<s> A central pressure bias was uncovered in relating to the slope of the unk and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique </s>
<s> Details of the method In a developing cyclone the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features and as they strengthen they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner </s>
<s> The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over hours to determine if the storm has weakened maintained its intensity or strengthened </s>
<s> Various central cloud and banding features are compared with unk that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity </s>
<s> If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm </s>
<s> In each case a T number an abbreviation for Tropical Number and a Current unk unk value are assigned to the storm </s>
<s> These measurements range between minimum intensity and maximum intensity </s>

<s> Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between miles per hour km h and miles per hour km h can have their center of unk obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge </s>

<s> unk applies forceful expressive brush unk and places the figure within a glass cage structure behind curtain like unk </s>
<s> This gives the effect of a man trapped and unk by his surroundings screaming into an unk void </s>
<s> Head VI was the first of unk s paintings to reference unk whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of screaming unk a loose series of which there are around surviving individual works </s>
<s> Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in unk s work </s>
<s> The hanging object which may be a light switch or curtain unk can be found even in his late paintings </s>
<s> The unk cage is a motif that appears as late as his masterpiece Study for a Self Portrait unk </s>
<s> Head VI was first exhibited in November at the Hanover Gallery in London in a showing organised by one of the artist s early champions Erica unk </s>
<s> At the time unk was a highly controversial but respected artist best known for his Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a unk which made him the unk terrible of British art </s>
<s> Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics John Russell later unk s biographer at the time dismissed it as a cross between an unk unk of its jaws and an unk in unk unk who has come to a bad end </s>
<s> In Lawrence unk wrote that the shock of the picture when it was seen with a whole series of heads was indescribable </s>
<s> It was everything unk </s>
<s> The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and unk was indeed one of unk s most original unk </s>
<s> Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from unk s unusually productive period and one of unk s finest unk </s>
<s> Head series unk s output is characterised by sequences of images </s>
<s> He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that images breed other images in me </s>
<s> His series were not always planned or painted in sequence sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone </s>
<s> The idea for the head series came after he returned unk late in from a stay in unk </s>
<s> In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting </s>
<s> Although he continued to paint he was a ruthless self critic given to unk unk with unk and no works survive from between and the winter of </s>
<s> unk Erica unk offered unk the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery </s>
<s> He agreed but had nothing in reserve to hang </s>
<s> In following years unk became perhaps the most important of unk s early champions she arranged this showing his debut solo exhibition publicised him widely and organised unk for international unk </s>
<s> Already years old unk viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination </s>
<s> Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years he had little choice but to present new works </s>
<s> He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition completing the series barely in time for the opening </s>
<s> The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are unk overwhelmingly unk unk and eerie </s>
<s> Coming early in unk s career they are uneven in quality but show a clear progression especially in how they unk and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with </s>
<s> Head I actually begun in the winter of and Head II show unk pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads they have half open eyes and a unk though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human </s>
<s> Heads III IV and V show fully formed unk recognisable as men and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere </s>
<s> These two broad ideas unk in Head VI which is as unk tortured as the first two paintings and as spectral as the middle three </s>
<s> In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments the first indication in unk s work of the influence of unk while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream </s>
<s> unk said that chance played a significant role in his work and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge </s>
<s> This was especially the case in the mid to late a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in unk unk and poker rooms </s>
<s> The following morning he would often approach his canvas in a bad mood of drinking under tremendous unk and drink I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing </s>
<s> He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work an image often would unk mid way through into something quite different from what he had first intended </s>
<s> He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist </s>
<s> To him lifestyle and art were intertwined he said that perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit unk </s>
<s> This is very evident in the series which began as a rather unk study of a collapsed head but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of unk masterpieces and arrived at an image that was to unk unk for the subsequent years </s>
<s> The series marks unk s first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms </s>
<s> For him the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated unk and had abandoned the need to present an outward face </s>
<s> He believed that under these circumstances all unk falls away and the social being becomes the sum of its unk which unk attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare bones features a mouth ears eyes a jaw </s>
<s> According to Russell the view out front ceases to be the only one and our person is suddenly unk fragmented and subject to strange unk </s>
<s> Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting the figures are always posed and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed </s>
<s> This unk is abandoned in unk s series </s>
<s> Head I completed late in is considered more successful than Head II </s>
<s> Although it is well regarded critically Head II is seen as something of a creative unk de sac while Heads III IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI </s>
<s> It is exceptional in unk s unk that works of their relative poor quality survive he was unk self critical and often unk or abandoned unk before they were completed </s>
<s> When pressed again by unk in to produce works for a New York show that she had been unk for a year he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on including several other unk </s>
<s> unk commissioned another showing to be held in for which unk painted three large unk modelled on unk s portrait </s>
<s> The gallery advertised the show as Francis unk Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by unk but in the end unk was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened </s>
<s> Description The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing </s>
<s> It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three dimensional glass cage </s>
<s> This framing device described by Sylvester as a space frame was to feature heavily throughout the artist s career </s>
<s> A unk hangs from the upper edge of the glass case falling just in front of the pope s face and partially covering his eyes </s>
<s> It is too unk drawn to identify with certainty but given the presence of similar objects in unk s later works may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the unk of a curtain the hanging unk was to become a signature for the artist </s>
<s> Apart from its symbolic meaning it has a unk function framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines </s>
<s> Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his unk May June where it is clearly a dangling light bulb </s>
<s> For unk these elements were intended to make the figure unk in and out of sight for the viewer alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off unk open or closed </s>
<s> The figure s mouth is opened wide as if screaming an expression unk took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in unk unk s Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his silent film Battleship unk </s>
<s> In the broadcaster unk Bragg asked unk about the still and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the unk of the human mouth </s>
<s> unk replied I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a unk landscape though I never succeeded in doing so </s>
<s> When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed unk said It should be all much more colour should have got more of the interior of the mouth with all the colours of the interior of the mouth but I didn t happen to get it </s>
<s> His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of unk oral cavities bought in a second hand unk kept in his studio and to which he often referred to </s>
<s> The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure s voice is unable to escape as if it is screaming in silence </s>
<s> unk later in life unk said that he had wanted to paint the scream more than the horror </s>
<s> I think if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream it would have made the scream more successful </s>
<s> The work evokes memories of the Second World War </s>
<s> The glass enclosure of his Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as unk photographs of Adolf unk trial before a Jerusalem District Court when he was held within a similar cage </s>
<s> unk strongly resisted literal comparisons though and stated that he used the device so he could frame and really see the image for no other reason </s>
<s> I know it s been interpreted as being many other things </s>
<s> Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio unk of late broadcasters who warned against the impending unk </s>
<s> Denis Farr notes that unk was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to unk shouting voices and trembling hands convey ing the harsh atmosphere of an unk </s>
<s> Influences The so called space frame had already been used by Alberto unk in the and the two artists became friends in the </s>
<s> However unk had by used it only in unk contexts before unk s unk and in turn influenced his use in The Cage of </s>
<s> A similar two dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore s works notably his unk for King and Queen constructed three years after unk s Head </s>
<s> It is difficult to unk how these artists influenced and informed each other </s>
<s> What is notable is that unk continued to use the motif with intervals until the end of his life </s>
<s> Sylvester suggests his finest example is the Three Studies of the Male Back </s>
<s> The full length golden curtain like folds painted in heavy brush unk are in part influenced by unk but also similar to unk s Portrait of Cardinal Filippo unk </s>
<s> unk unk the Old Master s device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer the black ground paint is visible through the folds making the separation all the more affecting </s>
<s> unk had already used similar forms in his Chicago panel and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed works especially in his screaming unk </s>
<s> He became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting and collected many reproductions of works by unk and unk in which it is employed </s>
<s> He had begun his career as an interior unk and designer of furniture and unk in the mid and later said that he liked rooms hung all round with just unk hung in even folds </s>
<s> unk or unk appear in unk s earliest works notably the Study from the Human Body always in portraits and always in front of rather than behind the figure </s>
<s> Head VI is closely modelled on unk s c Portrait of Innocent X today in the unk unk Gallery Rome </s>
<s> unk cautiously avoided seeing the original even when he spent three months in Rome in </s>
<s> Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination </s>
<s> Yet his fascination was all consuming and he reproduced variants of it unk for almost two decades an examination and homage described as without parallel in the history of art </s>
<s> unk s approach differs to unk s in a number of ways both artists were expressive yet unk s broad brush unk and freedom with paint contrast with unk s tight and controlled treatment </s>
<s> He unk unk s positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer s point of view elevating and unk him </s>
<s> This was already a common technique in commercial promotional photography but in unk s hands unk argues the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to unk observe </s>
<s> Although unk revered unk s portrait he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting </s>
<s> In interviews he said that he saw flaws in unk s work and that he viewed that social structure and order as according to art historian unk unk obsolete and decayed </s>

<s> The inclusion of a poem by Joyce I Hear an Army which was sent to Pound by unk Yeats took on a wider importance in the history of literary unk as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication at Pound s behest of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The unk </s>

<s> Constant k filter Constant k unk also k type unk are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method </s>
<s> They are the original and simplest unk produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components </s>
<s> Historically they are the first unk that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections </s>
<s> However they are rarely considered for a modern design the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response </s>
<s> History Constant k unk were invented by George Campbell </s>
<s> He published his work in but had clearly invented the unk some time before as his colleague at AT T Co Otto unk was already making improvements to the design at this time </s>
<s> Campbell s unk were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously </s>
<s> Campbell called his unk electric wave unk but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others </s>
<s> Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented an early and important variation was the m derived filter by unk who coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them </s>
<s> The great advantage Campbell s unk had over the unk circuit and other simple unk of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or unk of transition between pass band and stop band </s>
<s> It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained </s>
<s> The unk were designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating unk telephone channels on transmission lines but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that </s>
<s> The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded </s>
<s> However the ladder unk used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with unk of modern filter designs such as the unk filter </s>
<s> Campbell gave constant k designs for low pass high pass and band pass unk </s>
<s> Band stop and multiple band unk are also possible </s>
<s> unk Some of the unk terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below </s>
<s> Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two port sections and in the case of the unk being discussed an infinite ladder network of L sections </s>
<s> Here L should not be confused with the unk L in electronic filter unk L refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter L </s>
<s> The sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having unk unk and unk elements with unk unk </s>
<s> The factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience since it is usual to work in terms of half sections where it disappears </s>
<s> The image unk of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same </s>
<s> However for a mid series section that is a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element will have the same image unk on both ports due to symmetry </s>
<s> This image unk is designated unk due to the T unk of a mid series section </s>
<s> Likewise the image unk of a mid unk section is designated unk due to the unk unk </s>
<s> Half of such a T or unk section is called a half section which is also an L section but with half the element values of the full L section </s>
<s> The image unk of the half section is unk on the input and output ports on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid series unk but on the side presenting the unk element it is equal to the mid unk unk </s>
<s> There are thus two variant ways of using a half section </s>
<s> Parts of this article or section rely on the reader s knowledge of the complex unk representation of unk and unk and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals </s>
<s> unk The building block of constant k unk is the half section L network composed of a series unk Z and a unk unk unk The k in constant k is the value given by formula Thus k will have units of unk that is unk </s>
<s> It is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant Y must be the dual unk of Z </s>
<s> A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of unk as the size of the section in terms of values of its components such as unk unk etc </s>
<s> approaches zero while keeping k at its initial value </s>
<s> Thus k is the characteristic unk unk of the transmission line that would be formed by these unk small sections </s>
<s> It is also the image unk of the section at resonance in the case of band pass unk or at unk in the case of low pass unk </s>
<s> For example the pictured low pass half section has formula </s>
<s> Elements L and C can be made unk small while retaining the same value of k Z and Y however are both approaching zero and from the formulae below for image unk formula </s>
<s> Image unk See also Image unk unk The image unk of the section are given by formula and formula Given that the filter does not contain any unk elements the image unk in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary </s>
<s> For example for the pictured low pass half section formula The transition occurs at a cut off frequency given by formula Below this frequency the image unk is real formula Above the cut off frequency the image unk is imaginary formula unk parameters The transmission parameters for a general constant k half section are given by formula and for a chain of n half sections formula For the low pass L shape section below the cut off frequency the transmission parameters are given by formula That is the transmission is unk in the pass band with only the phase of the signal changing </s>
<s> Above the cut off frequency the transmission parameters are formula unk unk The presented plots of image unk unk and phase change correspond to a low pass prototype filter section </s>
<s> The prototype has a cut off frequency of unk unk s and a nominal unk k unk </s>
<s> This is produced by a filter half section with unk L unk and unk C unk </s>
<s> This prototype can be unk scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values </s>
<s> The low pass prototype can also be transformed into high pass band pass or band stop types by application of suitable frequency unk </s>
<s> unk sections Several L shape half sections may be unk to form a composite filter </s>
<s> Like unk must always face like in these combinations </s>
<s> There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L shaped half sections </s>
<s> Where a port of image unk unk faces another unk the section is called a unk section </s>
<s> Where unk faces unk the section so formed is a T section </s>
<s> Further additions of half sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or unk elements </s>
<s> It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image unk </s>
<s> This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance </s>
<s> The further the section is from the end of the filter the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating unk are masked by the intervening sections </s>

<s> Moffat had noticed that the unk design was getting progressively whimsical and resembled more of a magical place rather than a machine </s>
<s> It was designed by series production designer Michael unk who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be darker and unk and provide an easier access to the gallery of the ship when shooting </s>
<s> The Doctor also wears a one off costume Victorian themed which Smith described as a bit unk unk meets the Doctor </s>

<s> The unk also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes including the Doctor dressing up as him </s>
<s> Moffat is co creator of the BBC series Sherlock for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor </s>
<s> In addition the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme </s>
<s> Casting This episode marks the return of Jenna Louise Coleman who previously appeared in the series opener Asylum of the unk </s>

<s> It improved upon its predecessor the Mk unk Light Tank by introducing the extra firepower of a pounder gun </s>
<s> The War Office ordered tanks an order that eventually increased to </s>
<s> Production was delayed by several factors and as a consequence only to of the tanks were produced </s>
<s> The tank s design flaws combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions ruled out the use of unk in the North African Campaign </s>
<s> As a result the majority of the tanks remained in Britain although were sent to the USSR as part of the unk unk program </s>
<s> In early the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations one of which was equipped with unk </s>
<s> In May a small number of unk formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar and in June unk were attached to the Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air portable light tank to support British airborne forces </s>
<s> The unk were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft unk gliders </s>
<s> A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in instead they were attached to the new Airborne Division and became part of the Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment </s>
<s> The division used approximately unk during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June </s>
<s> The tanks were successfully landed by glider but they did not perform well </s>
<s> Several were lost in accidents and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces </s>
<s> A few days after the beginning of the operation the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support </s>
<s> By August most of the unk in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks and the remainder were replaced by the unk unk in December </s>
<s> unk did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by the last was retired in </s>
<s> There were several variations on the unk design including the unk self propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army </s>
<s> Development history Initial development The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII unk nicknamed unk was first developed in by Vickers unk as a private venture and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries </s>
<s> It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company </s>
<s> The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns </s>
<s> Vickers Armstrong installed on the Mk unk a pounder millimetre </s>
<s> in main gun paired with a </s>
<s> millimetre </s>
<s> in unk machine gun and mounted the two guns in a two man turret </s>
<s> The tank possessed a maximum of millimetres </s>
<s> in of armour </s>
<s> The prototype weighed approximately pounds kg and was powered by a horsepower kW Meadows engine </s>
<s> unk was on eight road wheels four per side with no separate driver or unk wheels and it was capable of a miles per hour km h top speed </s>
<s> The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models </s>
<s> The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by unk the tracks </s>
<s> For sharper turns the system returned to the conventional method of unk one track to turn the tank the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the unk and reduce its power unk </s>
<s> The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for unk and unk of oil for unk and each of the wheels was independently sprung </s>
<s> The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June the model was tested as a possible light cruiser since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor the Mark VI </s>
<s> The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the unk unk offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance </s>
<s> Despite this it was decided that it was essential for some unk to be produced and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program </s>
<s> Accordingly the War Office gave the unk the official General Staff specification number unk and in November accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank s range </s>
<s> Production The number to be produced was subject to unk as the War Office unk in their demand in July it requested that of the tanks be produced then increased the request to after a three day conference in November </s>
<s> Production was to begin in July but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of before increasing the number to </s>
<s> The number further increased to after Metropolitan unk Carriage and unk a company part owned by Vickers Armstrong that would be producing the tanks indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks </s>
<s> Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors </s>
<s> The War Office put their order on hold in a post Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle </s>
<s> Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour were nevertheless deployed against them the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re evaluate the suitability of the light tank design </s>
<s> The pre war role of the light tank that of reconnaissance meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross country abilities </s>
<s> Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May against the factories where the tanks were assembled </s>
<s> The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk unk estimates place the final total produced to be between and </s>
<s> The name unk was given to the Mk VII on September on the orders of the War Office </s>
<s> The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of and delivered at the end of the year </s>
<s> Transfer to airborne role The War Office and the Army were concluding at this point that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat and the unk was considered to be obsolete </s>
<s> This decision may have marked the end for the unk in active service several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat </s>
<s> The demise of unk was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain s fledgling airborne forces formed in June under the orders of the Prime Minister Winston Churchill </s>
<s> When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment which by was to include artillery and some form of tank </s>
<s> Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions but by May the feasibility of a </s>
<s> metric tons </s>
<s> long tons tank to be carried for miles km in a glider was accepted although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task </s>
<s> In a conference held on January it was decided that the General Aircraft unk currently under development would be used to transport a single unk tank or two Universal unk </s>
<s> The unk was chosen because it was an obsolete design and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces </s>
<s> Beginning in January training exercises were conducted carrying the unk and their crews inside unk gliders </s>
<s> These exercises were successful during the training by C Squadron of the unk Pilot Regiment which specialised in flying the unk over unk were made with an average of unk per crew </s>
<s> Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries with seven pilots killed during the training </s>
<s> When the unk was re designated as an airborne tank several changes were made to its design </s>
<s> A number of tanks had their pounder guns replaced with a </s>
<s> millimetre </s>
<s> in infantry support howitzer these tanks were then designated as unk unk Close Support </s>
<s> Additionally unk unk were added to those unk which still possessed their pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration </s>
<s> The unk experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces </s>
<s> One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in which particularly affected the airborne forces </s>
<s> The transport of of the tanks to the USSR under the unk unk Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces as did the loss of several more during Operation unk the invasion of Madagascar </s>
<s> A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December stated that approximately unk were available for use </s>
<s> In a memorandum dated January by Major General George F unk commander of the Airborne Division unk complained that he had been informed that of the tanks were available whereas only actually remained with no reserves to replace those lost in combat </s>
<s> This lack of sufficient replacement reserves combined with a War Office report that some unk airborne tanks would be required for the Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India led to the unk s eventual replacement by the US unk unk </s>
<s> Performance A number of design faults of the unk were revealed through its operational use </s>
<s> Its size limited the possible crew to three a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret resulting in too few crew members to operate the unk effectively </s>
<s> The gunner or commander in addition to his own duties had to act as unk for the pounder which caused delays in combat </s>
<s> A report on the tank written in January stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank controlling a troop of unk during combat would be almost impossible </s>
<s> Problems were also found with the unk unk fitted to the pounder to increase its range and penetration power after they had been fitted the unk could not be removed and could only fire specially designed armour piercing rounds which took time to manufacture </s>
<s> The War Office also considered the unk s cooling system faulty making the tank unsuitable for service in unk climates such as the Middle East and North Africa </s>
<s> Operational history unk lease The first unk were delivered to the Army in November and were initially deployed with the Armoured Division which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France and the newly formed Armoured Division </s>
<s> However the faults discovered with the unk cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign </s>
<s> Shortly after all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service </s>
<s> The unk remained in Britain and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service but on June the German invasion of the USSR Operation Barbarossa began and the USSR became an ally of Britain </s>
<s> The unk unk program begun in March by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China was therefore extended to the USSR </s>
<s> As part of the program the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR which in early included a shipment of unk as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks </s>
<s> The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British and so could use the unk </s>
<s> When the tanks arrived in the USSR however it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions additionally the cold weather had a unk effect on the tank s suspension and tracks </s>
<s> Additional testing of the unk was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its unk unk and speed as well its ability to run on low quality fuel unlike contemporary Soviet designs </s>
<s> The unk of the unk s armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank s speed </s>
<s> Despite these drawbacks in the unk s design Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T light tank in use at the time and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat </s>
<s> A number of unk were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle and in September two were assigned to the unk unk Tank Battalion which was attached to the Guards Tank Brigade both tanks were destroyed in combat one on September and the other on October the latter a casualty of artillery fire </s>
<s> Several were also used for propaganda purposes appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the unk region </s>
<s> Operation unk In mid the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations known as A B and C Special Service Squadrons </s>
<s> Both A and B Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark unk light tanks but C Squadron was equipped with twelve unk transferred from the Armoured Brigade Armoured Division </s>
<s> On July C Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside A and B Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate </s>
<s> All three squadrons were transported to unk in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and unk from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations </s>
<s> In early September elements of C Squadron including six unk formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany and the force was unk to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred </s>
<s> These fears proved unk and in March the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training </s>
<s> The next assignment Operation unk was the invasion of Madagascar the third largest island in the world and then under unk French control </s>
<s> The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of unk to Japanese naval forces which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean </s>
<s> Operation unk was under the command of Major General Robert G unk and consisted of No </s>

<s> The Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations and under its command was B Special Service Squadron created by unk six unk from B Squadron and six unk from C Squadron into a single unit </s>
<s> The squadron was formed into four troops one Headquarters troop of three unk and one unk one of four unk and two formed from the remaining five unk </s>
<s> The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on May near unk and the bay of Diego unk </s>
<s> The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip which would allow the British forces to advance approximately miles km and approach unk from the rear </s>
<s> Information about the landing beaches the defences possessed by the port and the unk French defending forces was limited and vague although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank </s>
<s> The landings began at on May with Commando landing at unk Bay and the three infantry brigades and B Squadron landing at unk Bay </s>
<s> The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of unk and a nearby town but although the infantry landed successfully B Squadron had more trouble the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a unk came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand </s>
<s> The infantry brigades advanced toward unk without the squadron but eventually two unk and a single unk were dispatched in support catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of unk </s>
<s> Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences consisting of camouflaged trenches and unk dug in along a ridge </s>
<s> The tanks attempted to breach them but the rocky ground made unk difficult and they could not close with the unk and trenches they engaged a number of targets with pounder and machine gun fire but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day </s>
<s> The tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island and they were soon joined by two other unk dispatched from the beaches the small force continued to advance until it encountered the unk French main line of defence </s>
<s> This had been built prior to the First World War and included camouflaged unk machine gun nests and dug in mm artillery pieces the latter although not specifically designed for an anti tank role could penetrate the armour of both the unk and the unk </s>
<s> The two unk advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire and two unk that were moving behind them suffered the same fate the third unk retreated in order to report on the French resistance machine unk a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back </s>
<s> The commander of the unk made his report and was then ordered to take command of four unk and two unk which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences </s>
<s> The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out flank the line by advancing from the right hand side using several hills as cover the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault however and one Valentine and one unk were hit and destroyed </s>

<s> Operation Tonga Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid when the British airborne establishment was formed the War Office was able to accept only volunteers for training as airborne troops </s>
<s> Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation Operation unk was conducted by a unk Commando unit </s>
<s> By there existed specifically trained airborne units including the Airborne Division and on January the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division </s>
<s> This unit designated the Light Tank Squadron was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division using their tanks speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units </s>
<s> The obvious unit for conversion was C Special Services Squadron as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and more importantly was the only unit that was still using unk it had been re designated as an airborne tank by the War Office </s>
<s> C Squadron was officially transferred to the Airborne Division on June bringing with it seven unk among its other vehicles </s>
<s> The unit immediately began training but was not attached to the Airborne Division for long during mid the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily </s>
<s> C Squadron remained in Britain as not enough unk gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its unk the squadron was transferred to the Airborne Division which had been raised in April and C Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict </s>
<s> The squadron continued to train as an air portable unit and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter attacking enemy infantry and armour </s>
<s> On December the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars and on April it was re designated as the Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment </s>
<s> The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron two unk the Mark unk variation were attached to the Headquarters Squadron but the Light Tank Squadron also known as A Squadron received the majority of the unk </s>

<s> On May after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres A Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at unk unk airfield while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF unk Norton airfield the next day from these two airfields the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy </s>
<s> The operation began on the night of June with the deployment of Airborne Division to eastern Normandy </s>
<s> It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied unk landings securing strategically important areas east of Caen capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River unk and destroying a coastal artillery battery </s>
<s> unk transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division s brigades simultaneously one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day </s>
<s> Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the unk Brigade to which the Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached to be landed first however aerial photography revealed that anti glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade </s>
<s> Therefore Gale decided that the Parachute Brigade and Parachute Brigade which did not unk gliders should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones allowing the unk Brigade to land in the second lift </s>
<s> The unk and unk gliders of the brigade landed at on June in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the Parachute Brigade </s>
<s> The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division the Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter attack </s>
<s> The unk of A Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed but the squadron s strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy </s>
<s> It lost one tank before the formation landed when the unk broke loose of its unk and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it causing both to fall into the sea mid flight </s>
<s> The squadron s strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone destroying themselves and the unk they carried a third unk hit another unk as it was being unk and flipped the tank upside down rendering it unusable although the crew escaped without injury </s>
<s> The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their unk forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding unk </s>
<s> The squadron retrieved all of the remaining unk and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment there they received orders to support the Parachute Battalion in the unk de unk area and conduct reconnaissance duties </s>
<s> After linking with the battalion the squadron began unk and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered </s>
<s> By the end of June two unk had been lost to enemy action one destroyed by a German self propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine </s>
<s> The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties </s>
<s> At this time Gale decided to avoid when possible engaging the unk with German armour as they proved to be completely unk by the German tanks and self propelled guns such as the Panzer IV and the unk III </s>
<s> Instead when the division required armoured support it summoned it from armoured units outside the division and the unk were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support </s>
<s> By August in the division s preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead the majority of unk in A Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks only three unk remained assigned to the Headquarters troop of A Squadron </s>
<s> Post war Operation Tonga was the last that unk saw of active combat </s>
<s> During the first week of October the Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive unk in which it was completely unk and all the remaining unk were retired </s>
<s> They were replaced with the unk unk a purpose built airborne light tank of American design eight unk were used by the regiment in March during Operation unk the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine </s>
<s> A report issued by the Director Air of the War Office in January confirmed that the unk design was considered obsolete and any light tanks used in post war airborne formations would be entirely new in design </s>
<s> A small number of unk remained in service with the Hussars until a unk glider flight was stationed at RAF unk and a troop of unk was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders </s>
<s> However glider training by the regiment was stopped in and the unk withdrawn from service </s>
<s> unk There were several variants of the unk design </s>
<s> The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII Vickers Armstrong s proposed successor to the unk </s>
<s> The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins named after President Roosevelt s chief diplomatic advisor and was given the General Staff design number unk by the War Office </s>
<s> The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the unk in a number of areas </s>
<s> It had thicker armour than the unk with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of millimetres </s>
<s> in and the side armour to millimetres </s>
<s> in and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help unk shells fired at the tank </s>
<s> The dimensions of the unk were also changed the Mark VIII was longer by inches </s>
<s> m wider by foot inches </s>
<s> m and heavier </s>
<s> The new tank was no longer air portable as it was too heavy to be carried by a unk </s>
<s> The cylinder engine of the unk was fitted to the Mark VIII although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to miles per hour km h its armament also remained the same as that of the unk </s>
<s> The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April </s>
<s> The new design was considered a success and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered to be constructed in September </s>
<s> However problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes and a report issued in December stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems </s>
<s> These problems continued to persist into when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service approximately Mark unk were produced by when production ended </s>
<s> A second variant on the unk design was the unk unk Drive unk DD </s>
<s> The unk Drive system was invented by Nicholas unk and was designed to allow a tank to swim through water and participate in amphibious operations </s>
<s> The system functioned by unk a large unk canvas screen around the tank above its tracks which was supported by thirty six unk tubes and steel struts this gave the tank sufficient unk to float and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank s engine </s>
<s> The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land </s>
<s> The system was fitted during June as the unk was the lightest light tank available at the time the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs allowing the unk Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks such as the Valentine </s>
<s> The system would be used during Operation unk when Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches </s>

<s> unk colossal heads The unk colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders </s>
<s> The heads date from at least before BC and are a distinctive feature of the unk civilization of ancient unk </s>
<s> All portray mature men with unk unk flat unk and slightly crossed eyes their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of unk and Veracruz </s>
<s> The backs of the monuments often are flat </s>
<s> The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los unk mountains of Veracruz </s>
<s> Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances requiring a great deal of human effort and resources it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual unk rulers </s>
<s> Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress </s>
<s> The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major unk centres but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear </s>
<s> The discovery of a colossal head at unk unk in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of unk culture by Matthew unk in </s>
<s> Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the unk unk on the Gulf Coast of Mexico </s>
<s> Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo unk were re carved from massive stone unk </s>
<s> An additional monument at unk unk in Guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head </s>
<s> This is the only known example from outside the unk unk </s>
<s> unk the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation </s>

<s> unk civilization The unk civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico between and BC </s>
<s> The unk unk lies on the Gulf Coast of Mexico within the states of Veracruz and unk an area measuring approximately kilometres mi east to west and extending about kilometres mi inland from the coast </s>
<s> The unk are regarded as the first civilization to develop in unk and the unk unk is one of six unk of civilization worldwide the others being the unk unk culture of South America the unk culture of China s Yellow River the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia the civilization of ancient Egypt and the unk civilization of ancient Iraq </s>
<s> Of these only the unk civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting </s>
<s> The unk were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities </s>
<s> They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture </s>
<s> In the first decade of the century evidence emerged of unk writing with the earliest examples of unk hieroglyphs dating to around BC </s>
<s> Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts the texts are short and have been partially unk based on their similarity to other unk scripts </s>
<s> The evidence of complex society developing in the unk unk has led to the unk being regarded as the Mother Culture of unk although this concept remains controversial </s>
<s> Some of the unk rulers seem to have served religious functions </s>
<s> The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La unk in about BC with unk unk and unk de los unk possibly sharing the role other urban centres were much less significant </s>
<s> The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear </s>
<s> Very fine unk art much clearly made for an elite survives in several forms notably unk figurines and larger sculptures such as The unk </s>
<s> The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery these were presumably widely available to the population </s>
<s> Together with these of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the unk style masks in stone so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an unk context </s>
<s> These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads </s>
<s> Two thirds of unk monumental sculpture represents the human form and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of unk art </s>
<s> unk The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated </s>
<s> However the San Lorenzo heads were buried by BC indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still </s>
<s> The heads from unk unk had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La unk were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface </s>
<s> The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium </s>
<s> Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from to years </s>
<s> The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest and are the most unk executed </s>
<s> All of the stone heads have been assigned to the unk period of unk chronology generally to the Early unk BC although the two unk unk heads and the La unk Head are attributed to the Middle unk BC </s>

<s> All of the unk colossal heads depict mature men with flat unk and unk unk the eyes tend to be slightly crossed </s>
<s> The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the unk region in modern times </s>
<s> The backs of the heads are often flat as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall </s>
<s> All examples of unk colossal heads wear distinctive unk that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals </s>
<s> Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head and some are decorated with feathers </s>
<s> A head from La unk is decorated with the head of a bird </s>
<s> There are similarities between the unk on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific unk may represent different dynasties or perhaps identify specific rulers </s>
<s> Most of the heads wear large unk inserted into the ear lobes </s>
<s> All of the heads are realistic unk and unk descriptions of the men </s>
<s> It is likely that they were portraits of living or recently deceased rulers well known to the unk </s>
<s> Each head is distinct and unk displaying unk features </s>
<s> They were once thought to represent unk although this theory is no longer widely held it is possible however that they represent rulers equipped for the unk unk </s>
<s> unk expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling </s>
<s> The most unk unk art is the earliest appearing suddenly without surviving unk with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed </s>
<s> Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El unk demonstrate that the unk are likely to have created many more unk sculptures than works sculpted from stone </s>
<s> In the late nineteenth century José unk y Serrano described a colossal head as having Ethiopian features and speculations that the unk had African origins resurfaced in in the work of Alfonso unk unk and in the in the writings of Ivan van unk </s>
<s> Such speculation is not taken seriously by unk scholars such as Richard unk and Ann unk </s>
<s> Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution </s>
<s> One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated </s>
<s> Heads did not just represent individual unk rulers they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself </s>
<s> unk The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available it seems likely that only the more powerful unk rulers were able to unk such resources </s>
<s> The workforce would have included unk labourers unk unk unk and other unk producing the tools to make and move the monument in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers </s>
<s> The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end </s>
<s> Archaeological investigation of unk basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small unk of stone </s>
<s> The sculpture was then refined by unk the surface using unk which were generally rounded unk that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself although this was not always the case </s>
<s> unk were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail </s>
<s> unk colossal heads were fashioned as in the round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the unk and unk </s>
<s> Monument at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche </s>
<s> Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned </s>
<s> It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed </s>
<s> All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the unk unk were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los unk mountains of Veracruz </s>
<s> Most were formed from coarse unk dark grey basalt known as unk unk basalt after a volcano in the range </s>
<s> unk have proposed that large unk unk basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments </s>
<s> These boulders are found in an area affected by large unk volcanic mudslides that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes which suggests that the unk did not need to quarry the raw material for unk the heads </s>
<s> Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head </s>
<s> The stone for the San Lorenzo and La unk heads was transported a considerable distance from the source </s>
<s> The La unk head was found on El unk hill in the Sierra de los unk and the stone from unk unk unk Head and unk unk Head also known as unk unk Monuments A and Q came from the same hill </s>
<s> The boulders were transported over kilometres mi from the source of the stone </s>
<s> The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown especially since the unk lacked unk of burden and functional wheels and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible </s>
<s> Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the unk transport of monuments weighing tons or more impractical </s>
<s> Two badly damaged unk sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes </s>
<s> A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block with their legs hanging over the side </s>
<s> These sculptures may well depict unk rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments </s>
<s> When transport over land was necessary the unk are likely to have used unk ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads </s>
<s> The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country </s>
<s> The construction of temporary unk using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau </s>
<s> Earth structures such as mounds platforms and unk upon the plateau demonstrate that the unk possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large scale earthworks </s>
<s> The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental unk from which they were reworked </s>
<s> Only four of the seventeen unk heads do not have flattened backs indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments </s>
<s> Alternatively the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport providing a stable form for unk the monuments with ropes </s>
<s> Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental unk unk and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments </s>
<s> Known monuments Seventeen confirmed examples are known </s>
<s> An additional monument at unk unk in Guatemala is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head </s>
<s> This is the only known example outside of the unk unk on the Gulf Coast of Mexico </s>
<s> Possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in unk </s>

<s> San Lorenzo The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north south across the site </s>
<s> Although some were recovered from unk they were found close to their original unk and had been buried by local erosion </s>

<s> He decided that a team s play will reflect the mood of its coach a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge </s>
<s> I don t want to lose a game because of my approach he told himself </s>
<s> Accordingly he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games </s>

<s> Because the orbit of the Moon is unk only from the ecliptic the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness </s>
<s> Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth based radar studies </s>

<s> unk illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the </s>
<s> The shadowed portion of the crater was unk with the unk Camera of the Japanese unk spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim </s>
<s> The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical slope that leads down to a </s>
<s> km diameter floor </s>
<s> The handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters </s>
<s> The bottom is covered by an uneven mound like feature that is to m thick </s>
<s> The central peak is about m in height </s>
<s> The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about K For unk the average temperature was determined to be about K reaching K at the crater floor </s>
<s> Under these conditions the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be to m s Any water vapor that arrives here following a unk impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface </s>
<s> However the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far side suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice </s>
<s> This crater was named after Ernest Henry unk an Anglo Irish explorer of Antarctica from until his death in </s>
<s> The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in </s>
<s> Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker unk de unk unk and unk </s>
<s> unk farther away on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side are the larger craters unk and Scott named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent </s>
<s> Exploration From the perspective of the Earth this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon making observation difficult </s>
<s> Detailed mapping of the polar regions and unk of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft </s>
<s> unk lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole unk basin which is one of the largest known impact formations in the Solar System </s>
<s> This basin is over kilometers deep and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior </s>
<s> A neutron unk on board the unk unk spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles including the crater unk </s>
<s> At the end of this mission in July the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth based telescopes an impact generated plume containing water vapor </s>
<s> The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals or that the impact site did not contain any ice </s>
<s> Alternatively it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the unk to liberate significant quantities of water vapor </s>
<s> From Earth based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge unk appears to be relatively intact much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts </s>
<s> This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle </s>
<s> In addition it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of unk since its formation </s>
<s> However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen possibly in the form of water ice </s>
<s> See Shoemaker lunar crater for example </s>
<s> Radar studies preceding and following the unk unk mission demonstrate that the inner walls of unk are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some unk craters </s>
<s> In particular the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its unk blanket suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface unk and not ice deposits as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the unk mission </s>
<s> This interpretation however is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community </s>
<s> Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of cm show no evidence for water ice deposits </s>
<s> Optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar unk spacecraft unk in </s>
<s> It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice down to the image resolution of m per pixel </s>
<s> On November a kg probe made a hard landing near the crater </s>
<s> The moon impact probe unk was launched from the Indian unk I spacecraft and reached the surface minutes later </s>
<s> The probe carried a radar unk video imaging system and a mass unk which will be used to search for water </s>
<s> Potential uses Some sites along unk s rim receive almost constant illumination </s>
<s> At these unk sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings </s>
<s> The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of C when the Sun is overhead to as low as C during the lunar night </s>
<s> While scientific experiments performed by unk and unk unk could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters the current evidence is far from definitive </s>
<s> There are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice as well as to the concentration of this ore with depth below the surface </s>
<s> Resolution of this issue will require future missions to the Moon </s>
<s> The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be mined for deposits of hydrogen in water form a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth </s>
<s> This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope </s>
<s> The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near continuous power to the observatory </s>
<s> About kilometers from the crater lies the km tall unk Mountain a peak that is unk visible from the Earth and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped </s>
<s> NASA has named the rim of unk as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost slated to be up and running by unk and continuously staffed by a crew by unk </s>
<s> The location would promote self unk for lunar residents as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels </s>

<s> It is more tempting to unk it as a portrait of the beauty underlying American unk and unk but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror and Ball s disgust with our unk </s>
<s> It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky s philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live </s>
<s> He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center a controlling voice who unk all of the choices </s>
<s> He contends that in American Beauty s case it is neither unk nor Ball </s>
<s> unk considers the voice to be Ball s but even while the writer was strongly influential on set he often had to accept deviations from his vision particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic </s>

<s> The feminist academic and author unk R unk argues that American Beauty uses its art house unk to direct its message of unk primarily to the middle classes and that this approach is a cliché of unk preoccupation the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual self through denial and unk is always open to those wealthy enough to choose and unk enough to present themselves unk as a rebel </s>
<s> Professor Roy M unk argues that the film s thematic center is its direction to the audience to look closer </s>
<s> The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the unk neighborhood with Lester s narrated admission that he will soon die forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them </s>
<s> It also sets a series of mysteries unk asks from what place exactly and from what state of being is he telling this story </s>
<s> If he s already dead why unk with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive </s>
<s> There is also the question of how Lester has died or will die </s>

<s> According to Patti unk colors are used symbolically throughout the film none more so than red which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and defines Lester s arc </s>

<s> unk and repression unk argues that American Beauty defines its characters through their sexuality </s>
<s> Lester s attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact </s>

<s> Lester s transformation conveys that he and not the woman has borne the brunt of lack of being and he will not stand for being unk </s>
<s> Lester s attempts to strengthen traditional unk conflict with his responsibilities as a father </s>
<s> Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively he does not become the unk figure implicitly celebrated in films like Fight Club </s>
<s> unk concludes that Lester s behavior toward Angela is a unk but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again </s>
<s> unk says the film explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against unk a recurring theme of Ball s work is his comparison of the unk against unk and homosexuality </s>
<s> Instead of making an overt distinction American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence </s>
<s> Col unk is so unk of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester </s>
<s> Ball said The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what they can do </s>
<s> The film implies two unk unk desires Lester s pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter while Col unk repression is exhibited through the almost unk discipline with which he controls Ricky </s>
<s> Consequently Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual while Angela s vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy </s>
<s> Col unk represents Ball s father whose unk homosexual desires led to his own unk </s>
<s> Ball rewrote Col unk to delay revealing him as homosexual which unk reads as a possible unk of Ball s own patriarchal unk fantasies </s>
<s> unk and music American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure only unk with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story </s>
<s> Although the plot spans one year the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death </s>
<s> Jacqueline unk says that the plot occupies no time or all time citing Lester s claim that life did not flash before his eyes but that it stretches on forever like an ocean of time </s>
<s> unk argues that a rhythm of repetition forms the core of the film s structure </s>
<s> For example two scenes have the unk sitting down to an evening meal shot from the same angle </s>
<s> Each image is broadly similar with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester s new found assertiveness </s>
<s> Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other </s>
<s> Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra and the image is reversed later for a similarly unk and unk scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment </s>
<s> Lester s fantasies are emphasized by unk and repetitive motion shots unk uses double and triple unk in several sequences and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy </s>
<s> One example is the unk scene Lester s first encounter with Angela </s>
<s> While the unk perform their half time routine to On Broadway Lester becomes increasingly unk on Angela </s>
<s> Time slows to represent his unk hypnosis and Lester begins to unk that Angela s performance is for him alone </s>
<s> On Broadway which provides a conventional unk to the unk action is replaced by discordant unk music that lacks melody or progression </s>
<s> This unk score is important to creating the narrative unk in the sequence it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length </s>
<s> The effect is one that Stan Link unk to vertical time described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that unk a single present stretched out into an enormous duration a potentially infinite now that nonetheless feels like an instant </s>
<s> The music is used like a visual cue so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela </s>
<s> The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of On Broadway and unk time </s>
<s> According to Drew Miller of unk the soundtrack gives unconscious voice to the characters unk and unk the subtext </s>
<s> The most obvious use of pop music accompanies and gives context to Lester s attempts to recapture his youth reminiscent of how the counterculture of the unk American repression through music and drugs Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music </s>
<s> unk song choices progress through the history of American popular music </s>
<s> Miller argues that although some may be over familiar there is a unk element at work making good on the film s encouragement that viewers look closer </s>
<s> Toward the end of the film Thomas Newman s score features more prominently creating a disturbing tempo that matches the tension of the visuals </s>
<s> The exception is Don t Let It unk You Down which plays during Angela s seduction of Lester </s>
<s> At first appropriate its tone clashes as the seduction stops </s>
<s> The lyrics which speak of castles burning can be seen as a metaphor for Lester s view of Angela the unk fantasy driven exterior of the American Beauty as it burns away to reveal the timid small unk girl who like his wife has unk developed a false public self </s>
<s> Production Development In Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and unk </s>
<s> He joined the United Talent Agency where his representative Andrew unk suggested he write a unk script to unk himself to the town as a screenwriter </s>
<s> Ball pitched three ideas to unk two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty which he had originally conceived as a play in the early </s>
<s> Despite the story s lack of an easily unk concept unk selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion </s>
<s> While developing the script Ball created another television sitcom Oh unk Up </s>
<s> He channeled his anger and frustration at having to unk to network demands on that show and during his unk on Grace Under Fire and unk into writing American Beauty </s>
<s> Ball did not expect to sell the script believing it would act as more of a calling card but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies </s>
<s> unk passed the script to several producers including Dan unk and Bruce Cohen who took it to DreamWorks </s>
<s> With the help of executives Glenn unk and Bob Cooper and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks he received unk from the studio known at the time for its more conventional fare that it would not iron the edges out </s>
<s> In an unusual move DreamWorks decided not to option the script instead in April the studio bought it outright for unk Fox unk Pictures October Films Metro Goldwyn Mayer and unk Entertainment </s>
<s> DreamWorks planned to make the film for million </s>
<s> unk and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film s development including casting and director selection </s>
<s> The producers met with about interested directors several of whom were considered A list at the time </s>
<s> Ball was not keen on the more well known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become nervous about the content </s>
<s> Nevertheless the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert unk neither accepted </s>
<s> In the same year unk then a theater director revived the musical unk in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall </s>
<s> Beth unk of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for unk with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility </s>
<s> unk came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at unk s house and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make early in his career he had been inspired by how the film Paris Texas presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty as well as parallels with his own childhood </s>
<s> unk later met with Spielberg impressed by unk productions of Oliver </s>
<s> and unk Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty </s>
<s> unk found that he still had to convince DreamWorks production executives to let him direct </s>
<s> He had already discussed the film with unk and Cohen and felt they supported him </s>
<s> Ball was also keen having seen unk he was impressed with unk keen visual sense and thought he did not make obvious choices </s>
<s> Ball felt that unk liked to look under the story s surface a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty </s>
<s> unk background also unk him because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production </s>
<s> Over two meetings the first with Cooper Walter unk and Laurie MacDonald the second with Cooper alone unk pitched himself to the studio </s>
<s> The studio soon approached unk with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules </s>
<s> unk accepted and later recalled that after taxes and his agent s commission he only earned </s>
<s> In June DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted unk to direct the film </s>
<s> Writing Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early </s>
<s> In about Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center </s>
<s> He watched the bag for minutes saying later that it provoked an unexpected emotional response </s>
<s> In Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial </s>
<s> unk a comic book telling of the scandal he was struck by how quickly it had become unk </s>
<s> He said he felt like there was a real story underneath that was more fascinating and way more tragic than the story presented to the public and attempted to turn the idea into a play </s>
<s> Ball produced around pages but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film </s>
<s> He felt that because of the visual themes and because each character s story was intensely personal it could not be done on a stage </s>
<s> All the main characters appeared in this version but Carolyn did not feature strongly Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles </s>
<s> Ball based Lester s story on aspects of his own life </s>
<s> Lester s re examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid like Lester Ball put aside his unk to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect </s>
<s> Scenes in Ricky s household reflect Ball s own childhood experiences </s>
<s> Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col unk a man who gave up his chance to be himself </s>
<s> Ball said the script s mix of comedy and drama was not intentional but that it came unk from his own outlook on life </s>
<s> He said the juxtaposition produced a unk contrast giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone </s>
<s> In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors Lester and Angela had sex by the time of shooting Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version </s>
<s> Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script feeling they were being unk the final unk to alter the scene came from DreamWorks then president Walter unk </s>
<s> He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology the hero has a moment of unk before tragedy occurs </s>
<s> Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey to achieve redemption </s>
<s> unk and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired </s>
<s> Early drafts also included a flashback to Col unk service in the Marines a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual unk </s>
<s> In love with another Marine Col unk sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the sin of being gay </s>
<s> Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film Col unk was the only character to have a flashback and because it removed the element of surprise from Col unk later pass at Lester </s>
<s> Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col unk though all that remained in later drafts was subtext </s>

<s> Ball and unk revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors and twice more before the first read through </s>
<s> The shooting script features a scene in Angela s car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty the scene differed from earlier versions which set it as a big scene on a freeway in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body </s>
<s> The change was a practical decision as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs </s>
<s> The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash but only half a day was available </s>
<s> Ball agreed but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky s where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman When you see something like that it s like God is looking right at you just for a second </s>
<s> And if you re careful you can look right back </s>
<s> Jane asks And what do you see </s>
<s> Ricky Beauty </s>
<s> Ball said They wanted to cut that scene </s>
<s> They said it s not important </s>
<s> I said You re out of your fucking mind </s>
<s> It s one of the most important scenes in the movie </s>
<s> If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie that is the line </s>
<s> Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence set in a unk it presents a turning point for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela </s>
<s> By the end of filming the script had been through drafts </s>
<s> Casting unk had Spacey and unk in mind for the leads from the beginning but DreamWorks executives were unk </s>

<s> Chris Cooper plays Colonel unk Scott Bakula plays Jim unk and Sam unk plays Jim Berkley </s>
<s> Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal happy and boring couple in the film </s>
<s> Ball s inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a bland boring heterosexual couple who wore matching clothes I can t wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring </s>
<s> Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same unk </s>
<s> unk insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater and the actors could not be present at every one </s>
<s> Several unk and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script </s>
<s> An early scene showing the unk leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester s relationship had reached </s>
<s> Spacey and unk worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another for example the scene in which Lester almost unk Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester s buying a car was originally strictly contentious </s>

<s> The milieu was pretty much unk USA unk mobile unk </s>
<s> The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters who are also unk </s>
<s> unk said All of them are very strained and their lives are unk </s>
<s> The unk household was designed as the reverse of the unk the former a pristine ideal but unk and lacking in inner balance leading to Carolyn s desire to at least give it the appearance of a perfect all American household the unk home is depicted in exaggerated darkness and symmetry </s>
<s> The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner unk s unk Street for the unk and unk homes </s>
<s> The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight between Ricky and Jane s bedroom windows and between Ricky s bedroom and Lester s garage </s>
<s> The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col unk watching from Ricky s bedroom mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex </s>
<s> unk made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot </s>
<s> The house interiors were filmed on the unk on location and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed </s>
<s> The inside of the unk home was shot at a house close to Interstate and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles the inside of the unk home was shot in the city s Hancock Park neighborhood </s>
<s> Ricky s bedroom was designed to be cell like to suggest his unk personality while at the same time blending with the high tech equipment to reflect his unk side </s>
<s> The production deliberately unk the use of red as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere </s>
<s> The unk home uses cool blues while the unk is kept in a depressed military palette </s>
<s> unk dominating visual style was deliberate and composed with a unk design that provided a sparse almost surreal feeling a bright unk hard edged near unk like take on American unk unk constantly directed his set unk to empty the frame </s>
<s> He made Lester s fantasy scenes more fluid and graceful and unk made minimal use of unk feeling that stable shots generated more tension </s>
<s> For example when unk used a slow push in to the unk dinner table he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters </s>
<s> He wanted to keep the tension in the scene so he only cut away when Jane left the table </s>
<s> unk did use a hand held camera for the scene in which Col unk beats Ricky </s>
<s> unk said the camera provided the scene with a unk off balance energy </s>
<s> He also went hand held for the unk of Ricky s unk footage </s>
<s> unk took a long time to get the quality of Ricky s footage to the level he wanted </s>
<s> For the plastic bag footage unk used wind machines to move the bag in the air </s>
<s> The scene took four takes two by the second unit did not satisfy unk so he shot the scene himself </s>
<s> He felt his first take lacked grace but for the last attempt he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground </s>
<s> unk was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag </s>
<s> unk avoided using close ups as he believed the technique was unk he also cited Spielberg s advice that he should imagine an audience unk at the bottom of the camera monitor to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a foot m screen </s>
<s> Spielberg who visited the set a few times also advised unk not to worry about costs if he had a great idea toward the end of a long working day </s>
<s> unk said That happened three or four times and they are all in the movie </s>
<s> Despite Spielberg s support DreamWorks and unk fought constantly over the schedule and budget although the studio unk little with the film s content </s>
<s> Spacey unk and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates </s>
<s> American Beauty cost DreamWorks million to produce slightly above their projected sum </s>
<s> unk was so dissatisfied with his first three days filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to unk the scenes </s>
<s> He said I started with a wrong scene actually a comedy scene </s>
<s> And the actors played it way too big it was badly shot my fault badly composed my fault bad costumes my fault and everybody was doing what I was asking </s>
<s> It was all my fault </s>
<s> Aware that he was a novice unk drew on the experience of Hall I made a very conscious decision early on if I didn t understand something technically to say without embarrassment I don t understand what you re talking about please explain it </s>
<s> unk encouraged some improvisation for example when Lester unk in bed beside Carolyn the director asked Spacey to improvise several unk for the act in each take </s>
<s> unk said I wanted that not just because it was funny but because I didn t want it to seem unk </s>
<s> I wanted it to seem like he was unk it out of his mouth without thinking </s>
<s> Spacey is so in control I wanted him to break through </s>
<s> Spacey obliged eventually coming up with phrases but unk could not always keep a straight face which meant the scene had to be shot times </s>
<s> The production used small amounts of computer generated imagery </s>
<s> Most of the rose unk in Lester s fantasies were added in post production although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed </s>
<s> When Lester unk about Angela in a rose unk bath the steam was real save for in the overhead shot </s>
<s> To position the camera a hole had to be cut in the ceiling through which the steam escaped it was instead added digitally </s>
<s> Editing American Beauty was edited by Christopher unk and unk unk unk began in the position but had to leave halfway through post production because of a scheduling conflict with Me Myself and Irene in which Chris Cooper also starred </s>
<s> unk and an assistant edited the film for days between the appointments </s>
<s> unk realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned </s>
<s> He believed he had been making a much more whimsical unk film than what came together in the edit suite </s>
<s> Instead unk was drawn to the emotion and darkness he began to use the score and shots he had intended to unk to craft the film along these lines </s>

<s> This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester s death as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane s request was not serious </s>
<s> However in the portion he used in the opening and when the full scene plays out later unk used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt </s>

<s> Hall s approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked unk to contrast with the turbulent on screen events and allow audiences to take in the action </s>
<s> Hall and unk first discussed the intended mood of a scene but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary </s>
<s> In most cases Hall first lit the scene s subject by painting in the blacks and whites before adding fill light which he reflected from unk or white card on the ceiling </s>

<s> After six days the residents took down the barricades and unk patrols resumed but tensions remained high over the following months </s>
<s> Violence reached a peak on August culminating in the Battle of the unk a three day pitched battle between residents and the unk </s>
<s> On August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the unk and the unk were withdrawn </s>
<s> The Derry Citizens Defence Association unk declared their intention to hold the area against both the unk and the British Army until their demands were met </s>
<s> The British Army made no attempt to enter the area </s>
<s> The situation continued until October when following publication of the Hunt Report military police were allowed in </s>
<s> The Irish Republican Army IRA began to re arm and recruit after August </s>
<s> In December it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA </s>
<s> Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area </s>
<s> Meanwhile relations between the British Army and the nationalist community which were initially good deteriorated </s>

<s> It has a majority nationalist population and nationalists won a majority of seats in the local elections </s>
<s> Despite this the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council unk Corporation from onwards </s>
<s> The unk maintained their majority firstly by manipulating the constituency boundaries unk so that the South Ward with a nationalist majority returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and unk Ward with unionist unk returned twelve councillors between them unk by allowing only unk to vote in local elections rather than one man one vote so that a higher number of nationalists who did not own homes were disenfranchised and unk by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency </s>
<s> The result was that there were about nationalist families and practically no unionists on the housing waiting list and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition </s>
<s> The South Ward comprised the unk unk unk Bishop Street and Foyle Road and it was this area that would become Free Derry </s>

<s> After the meeting of unk Corporation was again disrupted in August unk unk telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association unk and invited them to hold a march in Derry </s>
<s> The date chosen was October an unk committee was formed although in reality most of the organizing was done by unk and unk and the route was to take the unk inside the city walls where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march </s>
<s> The Minister of Home Affairs William Craig made an order on October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the unk Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day </s>
<s> In the words of Martin unk of unk this particular tactic provided the excuse needed to ban the march </s>
<s> When the unk attempted to defy the ban on October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary unk cordon </s>

<s> Subsequently the police broke ranks and used their unk unk on people in Duke Street </s>

<s> The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens Action Committee unk was formed with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice chairman </s>
<s> The first barricades Another group formed as a result of the events of October was People s Democracy a group of students in Queen s University Belfast </s>
<s> They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights starting out with about forty young people on January </s>
<s> The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter demonstrators at several points along the route </s>
<s> Finally at unk Bridge five miles outside Derry they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs some of them studded with nails and stones </s>

<s> On the third day of fighting August the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary B unk a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere </s>
<s> Before they engaged however British troops were deployed at the scene carrying automatic rifles and sub machine guns </s>

<s> The events of August in Derry and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the unk and led to a split in December into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA </s>

<s> History World War I On the outbreak of World War I in unk Ware a director of the Rio unk Company found that at years old he was too old to join the British Army </s>
<s> He used the influence of Rio unk chairman Viscount unk to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross </s>
<s> He arrived in France in September and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose </s>
<s> In March with the support of unk unk unk General of the British Expeditionary Force Ware s work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves unk Commission </s>
<s> The new Graves unk Commission had over graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October and registered by May </s>
<s> When municipal unk began to unk Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further unk </s>
<s> Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French unk under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government </s>
<s> Ware eventually concluded that it was not unk to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land grant it in unk and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British </s>
<s> The French government agreed under the condition that unk respected certain dimensions were accessible by public road were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages </s>
<s> Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government </s>
<s> As reports of the grave registration work became public the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers </s>
<s> By photographs had been dispatched to relatives </s>
<s> In March the Commission with the support of the Red Cross began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests </s>
<s> The Graves unk Commission became the Directorate of Graves unk and unk in the spring of in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to unk from relatives of those killed </s>
<s> The unk s work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war with units deployed in Greece Egypt and Mesopotamia </s>
<s> Formal establishment As the war continued Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post war period </s>
<s> Following a suggestion by the British Army the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers Graves was appointed by the British government in January with Edward Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president </s>
<s> The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves unk and unk after the war </s>
<s> The government felt that it was more appropriate to unk the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department </s>
<s> By early a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves </s>
<s> With the help of Edward Prince of Wales Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted </s>
<s> The suggestion was accepted and on May the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter with the Prince of Wales serving as president Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice chairman </s>
<s> The Commission s undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War </s>
<s> Once land for unk and memorials had been guaranteed the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin </s>
<s> By some unk graves had been identified and a further unk casualties were registered as having no known grave </s>
<s> The scale and associated high number of casualties of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead </s>
<s> Previous to World War I individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers </s>
<s> However the war required unk of a significant percentage of the population either as volunteers or through conscription </s>
<s> An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated even if they were low ranking members of the military </s>
<s> A committee under unk Kenyon Director of the British Museum presented a report to the Commission in November detailing how it envisioned the development of the unk </s>
<s> Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions </s>
<s> Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of unk that had developed between serving ranks </s>
<s> An article in The Times on February by unk Kipling carried the Commission s proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like </s>
<s> The article entitled War Graves Work of Imperial Commission Mr Kipling s Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet Graves of the Fallen </s>
<s> The illustrated booklet was intended to unk the impact of Kenyon s report as it included illustrations of unk with mature trees and shrubs contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos </s>
<s> There was an immediate public unk following the publication of the reports particularly with regards to the decision to not unk the bodies of the dead </s>

<s> Apart from a few exceptions due to local geological conditions the unk follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world </s>
<s> This makes the unk easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries </s>
<s> A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought iron gate entrance </s>
<s> For unk in France and Belgium a land unk near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments </s>
<s> All but the smallest unk contain a register with an inventory of the burials a plan of the plots and rows and a basic history of the cemetery </s>
<s> The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery </s>
<s> More recently in larger sites a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign </s>
<s> The unk within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size </s>
<s> The cemetery grounds are except in drier climates grass covered with a floral border around the unk </s>
<s> There is also an absence of any paving between the unk rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace </s>
<s> However Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and unk the nature of the war deaths </s>
<s> Cross of unk and Stone of Remembrance Typically unk of more than graves contain a Cross of unk designed by architect Reginald unk </s>
<s> This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in unk in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross </s>
<s> The cross is normally a unk four point limestone Latin cross mounted on an octagonal base and ranging in height from to feet </s>
<s> A bronze unk blade down is embedded on the face of the cross </s>
<s> This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self sacrifice </s>
<s> unk with more than burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance designed by Edwin unk with the inscription Their Name unk for unk </s>

<s> Some unk bear the text believed to be buried in this cemetery when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known </s>
<s> In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one unk covers more than one grave </s>
<s> The unk does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date and even then only if it is known and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death </s>
<s> Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its standard design </s>
<s> In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes such as Thailand and Turkey stone faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal unk </s>
<s> These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into unk ground </s>
<s> In Italy unk were carved from unk unk limestone because it was in more plentiful supply </s>
<s> In unk Military Cemetery in Greece to avoid risk of earthquake damage small unk are laid flat on the ground </s>
<s> The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia </s>

<s> Variety in texture height and timing of floral display were equally important unk unk </s>
<s> The beds around each unk are planted with a mixture of unk unk and unk unk </s>
<s> Low growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of unk ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from unk back during rain </s>
<s> In unk where there are pedestal grave markers dwarf varieties of plants are used instead </s>
<s> The absence of any form of paving between the unk rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs </s>
<s> Lawn paths add to the garden unk and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain </s>
<s> Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical dry unk is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission s unk as is the case in Iraq </s>
<s> unk areas require a different approach not only for unk but also to plants and styles of planting </s>
<s> Similarly there are separate unk unk in tropical climates </s>

<s> The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the Senate nor unk appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against unk </s>
<s> Following the accession of unk as emperor the Senate passed unk unk on unk his coins and statues were melted his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records </s>
<s> In many instances existing portraits of unk such as those found on the unk unk were simply unk to fit the likeness of unk </s>
<s> This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material </s>
<s> In addition the vast palace which unk had erected on the unk Hill known as the unk Palace was renamed the House of the People and unk himself took up residence in unk s former villa in the Gardens of unk </s>

<s> Large amounts of money were obtained from unk s silver and gold statues and unk forbade that similar images be made in his honor </s>
<s> Because he reigned only briefly unk s public works were few instead completing projects which had been initiated under unk rule </s>

<s> Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the unk crisis of unk s reign </s>
